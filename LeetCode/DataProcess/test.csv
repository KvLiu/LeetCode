44054,Sev was very helpful.  Sev showed us where to shop and the prices we could expect to pay.  Offered his assistance after handing us the room key.  Sev is a great guy to deal with when visiting Beijing.
44054,"We arrived in Beijing very early in the morning due to a delayed flight and Sev/East Apartments was very accommodating with helping us locate the building and getting us settled into the apartment. 
We were traveling in a group of 5 and found this apartment to be perfect for us- we stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment and there was plenty of space as well as a kitchen, two bathrooms and a washer (although, the washer did dye one of my white shirts a faint green). 
Overall, we had a great time here and would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to Beijing. The apartments look exactly like the photos that Sev has listed. 
It is located Southeast of the city center and gave us a chance to explore another neighborhood. The subway line 10 Shaungjing stop is not a far walk and taxis in Beijing are very affordable. 
Did I mention that Sev is pretty cute?"
44054,"It is a really massive apartment and really comfortable. Fully equipped for all you need in Beijing. Clean, nicely furnished and great size. 
Sev is an excellent host, we couldn't have survived without him,. Always there to lend his advice and help. It was so helpful! We really appreciated him. Thank you :)"
44054,"Sev was incredibly helpful, showed us around the neighborhood and was available in case any questions or concerns arose. Not only that but they  also offered us a tour service to the great wall which was really good! 

The apartment was well located with near access to the tube station (5min walk). There were lot of places to eat around too! 

I recommend it. :) Thanks for everything Sev. "
44054,"The appartment was ideal for our party of 6 adults; it was spacious, clean and conveniently located in an appartment complex with  subway, shops, restaurants within walking distance.  We were always able to contact Sev if we had any problem with our accommodation.  We would recommend these serviced appartments for a stay in Beijing."
44054,Nice place to stay when travelling in a group - metro is a five minute walk from the appartment and gets you quickly to most sites - definitively a plus considering the traffic and mostly poor availability of taxis in Beijing.
44054,We had a great experience in Beijing.  The apartment was just like the pictures.  Good space for dinner with family and friends.  Close to subway and shopping.  Sev was very helpful during a very busy National Holiday weekend in Beijing. 
44054,"The apartment was exactly what I expected (as per pictures). This is a very practical option for those travelling to Beijing. The apartment is clean, well-kept, beds are comfortable, and the service that Sev provides is excellent. Thanks Sev, for helping us around Beijing!"
44054,"Definitely the place to stay when in Beijing. Apartment is spacious, clean and in a great location. Sev was very helpful and a great host. We felt right at home and very much enjoyed our stay."
44054,"We had a great time staying at Sev's appartement.

The place was large and clean and close to public transportation which made the appartement an ideal base, as we went out to explore the huge city.

The 24 hour key service made both checking in and out of the appartement very easy.

I would recommend staying at Sev's anytime."
44054,"We recommend East apartments. Sev was great organising  our transfer from and back to the airport for us. The apartment  was clean and the beds really comfortable. Great location, close to transports and restaurants. Very nice area.
"
44054,"very good, the appartement looks exactly as described, big and clean, 3 couples fit easily,  Sev was very helpful and available on the phone anytime.

Thanks Sev"
44054,"This was my very first AirBnB stay and it was just what we wanted. Coming in ""blind"" so to speak we were very well taken care of. We were escorted to the apparent and it was clean and just what was promised. Everything worked and the beds were comfortable. I would suggest this place to anyone going to Beijing. The location was great too."
44054,"East Apartments is a wonderful Chinese community and convenient to local food stores, restaurants, the subway and a mall.  As a Western family we enjoyed the spectacular courtyard and music festivals on the weekends over the course of June.  Sev was quite responsive and always willing to happily help out no matter what time of day through his local staff.  "
44054,"good location, just 5-7min walk from the subway. The apartment is very clean and Sev was making it really easy for us! "
44054,"The apartment worked out perfectly for us. It was well-located near the subway and all the amenities.  The building was quiet and safe. The unit was clean and well equipped, with more than we could ask for, even wine glasses! Sev was a delight to communicate with, always responding quickly, and he even helped us find our next accommodation when we moved on. I strongly recommend this rental. "
44054,"spacious apartment and clean.. just a nice place fr the 6 of us adults.. i contacted Sev approx  2-3 months before my departure to beijing. 

we arrived approx  2.30AM . our transport sent us to East apartment, a bit challenge to find the place at that hour but our tour guide and Sev's staff communicated along the way and Sev's staff waited for us at the gate. The check in and check out process is smooth ;)
its a 24hrs gated residence and we feel safe.

For muslim traveller if you are finding muslim/halal food, there is 1 shop nearby the apartment, approx 5 min walk..we even are friends wit them now..just say you know them from their MALAYSIaN friends..haha

There are a lot of shops and a small mall nearby, approx 10mins walk.

The nearest subway is Shuangjing (exit A), approx 15-20 walk based on our group walking experience.


 "
44054,Very nice and super clean apt. Sev is super responsive! The subway is just a short walk away from the apt and there is a mall near that subway as well. It's not too far by subway to central touristy areas. The Internet connection was great too! Would stay again!
44054,"Apartment was spacious, clean and set in an attractive and safe area, a short walk to nearest subway station and some great places to eat nearby - can't ask for much more!  

Sev and staff were immensely helpful and gracious hosts.  All in all - highly recommended and would happily stay again!"
44054,The listing was great for our group and it was in a nice location with a lot of interesting places nearby
44054,"Great location, easy to go to the famous attractions by metro. Many restaurants and super markets nearby. The staff is really friendly and helpful. Check-in/out both processed well, and they're willing to help you for anythings you need. Highly recommend to family group to stay here!"
44054,"We were made feel very welcomed. Appartment is very clean and just as the photo and description say.  About 1.5 km walk to main shops and subway.  Very secure and safe area.  
Found very noisy with 24hr construction work going on outside the appartment.  Not a lot of sleep.  Beds not bad but fairly firm. Well equipped kitchen. "
44054,Sev was zelf ter plaatse om de sleutel te overhandigen. Tegenover het appartement wordt een luxe mall gebouwd. Metro station is in de buurt waardoor de rest van Beijing goed bereikbaar is. 
44054,Service excellent.  Internet connection not very good.
44054,"The host was helpful in letting us in and showing us around. The apartment was very spacious, in a nice complex with peaceful courtyard and laid out well. Kitchen was stocked. The area was convenient, near the metro and many restaurants and shops. The neighborhood was very friendly, nice and safe.
Though the mattresses were comfortable, the beds were all super squeaky. And overall the apartment needs cosmetic repair with some damaged furniture, floor trim, faulty doors, and wobbly shower. 
The pool for guests is like 6 blocks away, so not really easy to use."
44054,Apartment was larger than expected and in a good area. Had all the necessary amenities.  
44054,"非常美好的一次入住体验,我们两家带着孩子和老人一共五大两小,在那里住的非常舒服,还给宝宝熬了小米粥和梨水?像在家一样,没有旅途的劳顿?离七号地铁线广渠门外非常近,东北口上来步行不到五分钟就到?小区进出都要用卡,非常安全?小区绿化很好,服务非常到位,阿姨热情周到,每天都有打扫,下次去北京还会选择这里?"
44054,"Nice apartment. Some problem about the date of booking but it get sorted out quickly. Friendly and helpful Ah Yi, thumb up!
The car park was terrible though, like a maze, a lot of walking and it smells very bad.  Shouldn't have drive.
Guangqumen subway station at line 7 only few minutes walk; Shuangjing station at line 10 about 20 minutes away."
44054,房子非常好~小区非常棒~离地铁站非常近~~设施非常齐全~~服务非常到位~~完全满意~
44054,"房间外面看的景色不错,就是洗澡的龙头有点高,房间很好.很舒服,第一次来北京,暖气很足~"
44054,"We are very much satisfied of the place. The owner is very responsive from all the questions. The place is very clean and the maid is very helpful. All in all,it's worth the money!"
44054,好!!
44054,"非常好的居住体验,交通便利,设施齐全,我们的房间在最顶层,客厅看出去的夜景不错?"
44054,Nice and clean apartment with everything we need although the kitchen is a bit small. The host is very accommodating. 
44054,"The apartment is lovely and spacious. The location is perfect, just within 3 mins walk from line 7 ""Guangqumenwai"" station (Do not attempt to arrive by ""Shuangjing Station"" which is a like 1KM away especially when you carry multiple luggage). You get every household appliances and utility you need for family travel in the house and a supermarket plus a fruit store very closed to the gate (we cooked everyday morning for breadfast). What impressed me most (as a southerner) is that the house is equipped with excellent heating system, even the floor is warm and you will ALWAYS get hot water in bathroom and kitchen.

Sev is extremely helpful and responsive. Sev is English native speaker and fluent in Mandarin as well. He can answer any questions.  Cleaning crews did there job very well and made cleaning everyday in detail. 

Will definitely choose East Apartment next time! "
44054,"房子地理位置很方便,出了地铁7号线,走五分钟就能找到?照片与实物一致,房间很干净,我们六个人住了两晚,白天还有阿姨来来打扫,浴室的洗澡水很大很热,很满意,沙发能坐下六个人,厨房有餐具有锅,总体来讲,是一次满意的住宿~"
44054,"地段很棒,在一个高档小区中,需要刷卡进出,周边有711和水果店等?只是找起来有些不方便?
我们的房子总体很满意,特别是房间的隔音非常不错,对于晚上要玩到很晚的人这一点很重要?
有些不称心的地方是客厅的空调坏了,找了物业来查看,确认不是电路的问题,而是空调本身的问题?因为我们只住两晚,请人来修不方便,所以工作人员给我们搬来了一架电风扇临时使用?
另外房间里的插座都不太好使,充电只能在厨房?浴室里充?
总的来说是一次不错的体验?"
44054,"Arrival: we contacted 4 different people to arrange to get into the apartment. Waited for 20 minutes to be met after arriving.
Acomedation: locks on both bathroom doors broken - these were not fixed after being told they would be. Power cut on the last day from 10am to after 1pm. Hosts responded after 20 minutes to give Wi-Fi password. Dishes were washed everyday, washing machine and air conditioning worked. Host have a second set of keys (for a party of 6 people) within five hours of I'd requesting this. Water was not refilled 36 hours after we used it up. We bought and carried water back to the apartment ourselves
Location: 5 minute walk from line 7, 10 minute walk from line 10. Four restaurants and a fruit shop within a 3 minute walk."
44054,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
44054,很完美的一次旅行!宝贝很开心!全家人都说房子不错!每天都休息的很好!有种家的感觉!很舒心!服务也很周到!以后还会光顾的!
44054,"房东很热情,在出地铁口之后会帮我们指路?房子也很好,里面设施齐全?周围也有相应的商店?去北京旅游时,人数较多的话,是一个比较不错的选择?"
44054,"这是一家专门出租的酒店式公寓 
一大家子住这里还是很方便的 master room有三张床 家人一起住这比住酒店更方便交流和互动 房间也不错 客厅的沙发太蓬了 坐着稍稍有点不舒服 还有就是相对的房间内设施老旧了一些 挑剔的人可能会有点不舒服 但是整体而言还是不错的 "
44054,"小區地理位置還行,有公交站有地鐵,但圖片和實際設備有距離,洗衣機髒,洗出來衣服很多毛絮,除了飲水機沒有配電燒水壺,廚房的配的電動壺是用不了的,後來反饋後給我們送來了一個,熨斗很髒,不敢拿來燙衣服,廚具都是沒有蓋子的不知道為什麼,找也沒有找到.Wi-Fi也很慢很慢,偶然在房子裡辦公,都會被Wi-Fi抓急~床單也有些黃."
44054,"房东反馈比较快,就是晚上会比较难找到人,在外面玩通常回来的有点晚,所以碰不上面,解决问题要等早上"
44054,"great host and apartment. The apartment is well kept and tidied daily. Its near the metro station and there are many small eateries around.
Thank you once again for making our stay comfortable"
44054,"The apartment is a short walk from a decent shopping mall and supermarkets. It is quite big and there is plenty of room in the lounge to sit and relax. The only downside was the WiFi being very slow in the evenings but it is ok in the mornings. The host is great, very helpful and cooperative. They organised a reasonably priced airport shuttle for our departure and replied very fast to all messages. "
44054,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
44054,"房子不错,很适合跟朋友一起住,附近的交通和超市很便利"
44054,"房东人很好,虽然不是中文沟通,但房东还会用一些中文?英文也很简单,几乎学过的都会懂?房子很大?非常不错?"
44054,The apartment is very close to the subway station which makes going anywhere very convenient. The apartment was clean and it was nice that it was cleaned every day. They answered all of our questions quickly and were very nice and responsive. 
44054,"交通相当方便,离地铁7号线只有三四分钟的路程,门口有饭店,不远处还有超市,小区进出刷卡,比较安全?房间面积比较大,床多,住十个人没什么问题?就是陈设家具与照片完全不一致,略显陈旧?三间卧室,其中大卧室空调效果不太好,需要改进?"
44054,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
44054,"位置较为方便,进出小区需要门禁卡很安全,同时希望房东多提供几张门禁卡方便出入?房间内是纯白的床单被罩,类似酒店的床铺设计?有简单的电器,厨房不提供调料等,物业热水管道修理,房东赶快安装了热水器?第一次在国内用airbnb,和国外略有差异,希望能更用心做得更好!"
44054,"Wonderful stay, convenient area... a few min away from Train Station... surrounding are near to eatery & goodies..."
44054,"一家人出行8个人住 非常适合?整体感觉非常好 ?可以做饭 厨具都一应俱全 ?先说优点吧 :1?靠近地铁站只需要走5分钟就到广渠门的地铁口 ?出行非常方便?2?小区环境不错 3?服务态度很好?有问题就马上解决了也给我们提供了极大的方便?
不足之处大概就是附近大超市离得有点小远 家乐福有1km 哈哈 然后就是洗衣机当时有些问题没有使用?其余都很好?整体给就是5星?提出建议是因为觉得可以做的更好~^_^"
44054,"Very close to line 7 and not too far from line 10. Check in/out was flexible. Washer and appliances worked great. Sev was very quick with communication on (Hidden by Airbnb) . Would stay again if I'm ever in Beijing again.

Thanks!"
44054,房东非常nice 帮我们解决了一系列问题?阿姨每天都会来定时打扫卫生?很棒哦
44054,真的很值得一住
44054,"房东不是中国人,但很体贴,沟通障碍小,值得再次预定!"
44054,Great location! ...very close to a subway stop. Host was extremely helpful and great on communication! Definitely helped us make the most of our time in Beijing!
44054,"Good location and good services from Sev and his team.
They provide daily cleaning services that surprising me.
Very quick responses from Sev."
44054,"房间很干净,家人很喜欢?如果能够提供洁具就更好,另外床垫稍显软了一点"
44054,"地理环境很好治安也让人放心!!屋子非常大而且很整洁!里面什么都有特别方便~~房东热情好客很好沟通很负责的~会说英语的小伙伴一定要试试,还能锻炼口语呢"
44054,"适合家庭旅游居住?整体空间不错?唯一不足的就是浴缸和床品不干净,希望可以改善"
44054,"Good location, excellent communication and responsiveness. Had some issues with the cleanliness but was told that the usual cleaning service is out for the holidays. Subway is right across the street. Convenience store and good food options are very near."
44054,"Great location (close to subway, restaurants and attractions around), good service and contact with the operator."
44054,Everything seems good~ Host prepared drinking water for us. Although there is daily housekeeping but do take note need improvement of the floor cleanliness and toilets. Travel distance to subway just across the street.
44054,"坐落在市中的繁华地段,房东是一位非常好客的先生,这次节假日与7位朋友一同来北京玩,由于安排计划较晚,已经没有合适的酒店了,于是就尝试了airbnb,没想到第一次就有这么好的入住体验,好评!"
44054,"Great location! Close to many stores and restaurants and 2 subway entries and exits. Overall the apartment was great. The apartment was clean and had nice rooms, beds were comfortable, 2 of the beds were very squeaky, bolts may need to be tighten, one in each of the back bedrooms. 

Last couple of days we had no WiFi or little WiFi like it worked for an hour and then stopped again. Only reason this was a problem it was our only way to communicate with our tours guides and ride back to the airport. Had to walk 20 minuets down to the Starbucks to check messages. 

We had an amazing time in Beijing and EastApts, worked very hard to help with the small issues and always responded quickly. Highly recommend them for friends and family."
44054,"地铁7号线很近,10号线远一点,其他都挺好的"
44054,"I stayed here in a group of 9 people, and there was plenty of space for everyone. The beds were super comfy, there were hair dryers, irons, a washing machine, cooking utensils...everything we needed. The host provided almost immediate responses to anything we inquired about. And the location was amazing- right next to subway line 7 (Guangqumenwai) and less than 10 minutes walking to line 10 (shuangjing). Also within walking distance were shops for drinks and restaurants, and a mall was also nearby. The apartment is inside a beautiful gated community. I highly recommend this place!"
44054,Awesome host. Easy communication. Very clean. Easy access to subways stations. Couple minutes walk from restaurants and convenient stores. Would stay here again.
44054,"good location,fast response host,helpful host,suitable for a family"
44054,沙发再舒适些更好
44054,"感谢美女工作的热情解决问题的态度!让我们家庭之行很愉快,但是房间内设需要改善"
44054,"Great location, family friendly, spacious place but it needs some minor updates like s cons shower area, kitchen etc. overall great stay."
44054,"De woning is ruim. De slaapkamers zijn groot en schoon. De locatie is ook heel prettig, omdat het appartement naast het metrostation is. Veel restaurantjes en bars in de buurt. 
De hosts zijn heel vriendelijk en behulpzaam. Zij hebben zelfs een trip naar de muur voor ons geregeld."
44054,"远就是地铁口,超市,非常方便?房东服务也很赞"
44054,"Dejlig lejlighed med god beliggenhed. Meget kort afstand til metrostationen Guangqumenwai. Kommunikationen har fungeret up?klageligt, v?rten reagerer meget hurtigt. Der er sengepladser til 8-10 personer, men kun spiseplads til 7 personer."
44054,All ok 
44054,"ótima localiza??o, muito perto do metro, restaurantes e mercado e até um shopping! A recep??o e comunica??o com o anfitri?o foi ótima! A única coisa que falhou foi a limpeza do apartamento! Estava muito sujo e a pessoa da limpeza n?o ia sempre, tenho certeza que o anfitri?o buscará a solu??o :)"
44054,"location are great, spacious house, rooms are somewhat noisy as 2 rooms are directly facing a busy street"
44054,"位置好,公寓干净漂亮,沟通和服务也很好,住的很舒服!推荐"
44054,Sev was extremely helpful and responsive. He accommodated to all requests and helped as soon as he could. The location is great and surrounded by little restaurants and bars. I would definitely recommend this apartment to others.
44054,"good area to stay, several shop surrounding the apartment. house need to refurbish and to be slightly more clean. comfortable sleep and sufficient space for 6 of us."
44054,"房源离广渠门外地铁站近,离双井地铁站远一些?房东很好,入住的时候没有水了也立刻找人换上,不过大门口进出需要房卡,大冷天的在门口等了一会儿才有人接待?"
44054,We had a comfortable stay in East Apartments. We were able to sleep all 8 persons comfortably. The subway station was just a few minutes walk opposite the apartment which made it convenient to travel out to the rest of the city. Sev and his team were super responsive to meeting all our needs and requests. 
100213,满意
100213,Great host. Very responsive and accommodating! Very helpful in arranging transportation and giving recommendation. Good vibe in the guesthouse among all guests thanks to good food and common meals. Nice and lovely accommodation.
128496,"A beautiful place, rich history, and Cindy is the one and only.  Lively and warm, but never overbearing.  She knows everything there is to know about Beijing, and is more than helpful in pointing you in the right direction.  She's also one of the funniest people I’ve been lucky enough to cross paths with.  

The rooms are decorated by Cindy, herself.  And it shows.  Each room is cozy and charming, and evokes a sense of home that is rare for me to come across in my travels.  Her courtyard provides an unexpected oasis from bustling Beijing.  From the minute I stepped through her front door, I wished I could extend my trip.  Who can resist sitting on her swing, watching dusk settle over the courtyard; a thousand leaves rustling gently in the breeze, moon peaking crescents over sky.  Or waking up to breakfast on her rooftop deck, gifting a rare view of morning sunlight painting the gently sloping rooftops of one of Beijing's few remaining  hutong neighborhoods.  

In all my travels—from high design boutique hotels, to humble countryside dwellings—Cindy’s home easily sits within my top five.  Simply put, the place has heart. "
128496,I sort of hesitate to write this...when you find a hidden treasure you want to keep it all to yourself !!!. WOW..this was something so special and so unexpected finding this home away from home in such a perfect setting. Was like stepping back in time and leaving the hustle and bustle of Beijing behind. What a perfect place to stay and what a wonderful host Cindy makes !.  As an aussie I was so surprised to find that vegemite was on the menu for breakfast ..have NEVER been to a place that took care of their guests so well. This is an area of Bejing that those poor travellers that chose to stay in impersonal hotels will never get to experience.  Cindy was full on information on what to see and do but to be honest once I was sipping on an ice cold beer on the rooftop balcony enjoying the view and the wonderful company I did not want to be anywhere else. The room was so comfortable and so well decorated and yet stepping outside was like stepping back in time. This is it for me...whenever Im in Beijing THIS is the place for me...keep my room ready Cindy !
128496,"I was travelling on my own at the end of a business trip and looking for an interesting, central, safe place to stay in Beijing for a few days. Cindy's place ticked off all those boxes, but my stay there exceeded all of my expectations! 

Cindy and her husband went out of their way to make me feel welcome, suggesting places to go and helping to navigate Chinese menus! Chatting with them about their daily life in Beijing was fascinating - though it was not my first time to China, I felt like I left with a much better understanding of Chinese society,

The hutong itself is beautifully and uniquely decorated, and the courtyard is a quiet haven from bustling, sometimes chaotic, Beijing. The room I stayed in was very spacious and comfortable, with a private bathroom and all the necessary hotel amenities (linen, shampoo, hairdryer etc.) yet felt like you were in the guest room at a friend's place!

I would definitely recommend staying here :)

"
128496,"Courtyard B&B is a lovely, peaceful haven and a perfect escape from the noise and crowds of Beijing. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and charmingly decorated. The location is ideal: convenient to tourist attractions and metro stations but tucked away in a traditional neighbourhood bustling with locals going about their daily activities. After a day or so, we fancied ourselves temporary Beijingers rather than tourists. 

Cindy and Nico are extraordinarily gracious hosts. When my partner unexpectedly missed his flight, Nico travelled all the way to the airport to find me so that I wouldn't be waiting and worried. Cindy was kind enough to purchase a fantastic cake and gorgeous flowers after my partner told her that he wanted to surprise me for my birthday. I have never before experienced hosts going so far out of their way to help two unknown guests. 

Cindy and Nico are very well travelled and educated and great conversationalists. I learned more about contemporary China from Cindy than from any of my books. She has worked incredibly hard to preserve and renovate her family's hutong and it was a privilege to stay in such a unique home. And the terraces are genius - not something you'll be likely to find anywhere else in Beijing! 

We cannot recommend Courtyard B&B highly enough - it's a very special place with incredibly helpful and generous hosts . We can't wait to be back in Beijing to see Cindy and Nico again, this time with a more relaxed schedule so that we can finally enjoy a bottle of wine together!
"
128496,"I first heard about Cindy a few weeks ago from a friend and her son who had just returned from a trip to China. When I mentionned that I was looking for a place to stay in Beijing while searching for more permanent accomodation, their enthusiastic praise for Cindy's courtyard made it an obvious choice for me. 

Besides enjoying the amazing location (just a few minutes walk from Dong Si Shitiao station), I quickly came to realize that I could not have found a better place to begin my new adventure in China's capital. 

Cindy and Nikos are kind and caring hosts who consistently go above and beyond their duty of care for their guests. During my stay at their courtyard I was so welcome that I came to feel almost as a part of the family.

The courtyard is beautiful, but the real gem here lies with the people who live there. Besides the pleasure of getting to know Cindy and Nikos, I practiced my Mandarin with Cindy's mom while being introduced to Beijing's Farmer's Market, learnt to cook some traditional dishes with Cindy's cousin and was graciously welcomed by their neighbours. To top it all off, we worked together to host a great BBQ for a group of friends in Beijing I had met on a previous trip in 2008!

I am now a permanent resident in Beijing, and my friends and family know this is the perfect place to stay whenever they come and visit me - thank you Cindy!"
128496,"It is quite impossible to review Cindy and her place.  We spent 8 days with them and had one of the best AirBnB experiences yet.  Cindy, her mom and her husband Nikos (yeah he's Greek) exemplify what AirBnB is about.  They provide a friendly, relaxed and affordable home away from home.  She and her husband are available night or day for anything.  At the end of our stay we were sad to say goodbye, but luckily we'll be staying with them again for a few nights in October.  If you're in Beijing and the location is convenient, definitely stay with Cindy."
128496,"Cindy's place is incredible. It's a spacious and beautiful hutong, offering quite a unique place to stay on your trip to Beijing. 

It was easy to get to her flat from the train station and Cindy met us at the top of the metro (line 2) to bring us the rest of the way. Her location is perfect as this particular metro line hits some of the main tourist destinations in the city.

Cindy was so welcoming and friendly. She made us feel right at home. That night she even hosted a traditional Beijing dinner, which we enjoyed with a few other AirBnBers who were staying there the same time as us.  She also provided us with a map to navigate the city, offered some great ideas for things to see and do and made breakfast for us every morning!

There are a few rooms available in the hutong, but never once did we feel imposed upon. The bathrooms and rooms are all separated and spread apart from one another. It's even more spacious than if we were to stay at a hotel and it gave us the opportunity to meet some really great people and share tips on things to do around the city.

I'd highly recommend staying at Cindy's place. We couldn't have asked for a better experience and if I ever make it back to Beijing, Cindy's will be the first place I choose to stay! "
128496,"On my 4th business trip to China, I was looking for a place to stay that offered a more local experience than a typical business hotel. Cindy's guest house made all the difference. She is a warm and witty hostess who offers local insights and suggestions. The location is central and easily accessible with just a short 5 minute walk to the subway.  My guest room was very comfortable with a nice bed, WiFi and good shower / toilet facilities. The courtyard is just a wonderful oasis within a busy, bustling city. I particularly enjoyed exploring the neighborhood, the beautiful courtyard plants, Bell Cat, Cindy's irreverent humor, warm smiles from Cindy's mother, visiting with other guests and early morning tea on the rooftop deck. Hats off to Cindy for this delightful gem. Can't recommend it more highly. 
"
128496,"Very highly recommended. It was my first trip to Beijing, and I am so grateful for Cindy and her accommodations for making it a great trip. The courtyard room is very clean and well decorated, close to the subway line and in the middle of the city.

Cindy was a great host and helped us find the restaurants, tour guides, and more. Beijing is an intimidating city, but Cindy was always there to help out."
128496,"Cindy's place was awesome!  My sister and I stayed with her for 4 nights-Cindy gave us instructions in Chinese for the cab driver- and even better she was waiting for us when the cab stopped by her house!!  Her place is adorable and cozy, we slept great and it was very quiet every night even though we were in one of the biggest cities in China!  We enjoyed AMAZING dinners with Cindy during our stay, she took us to a couple local restaurants (within walking distance) and really gave us a great experience in China.  If we ever go back, we will stay here again 100%.  I highly recommend.    "
128496,"Cindy and her husband were very friendly and helpful for our stay in Beijing. Their courtyard location is well maintained for the area, you can tell they spend a lot of time in making it a really nice. Finding the place could have been tricky but Cindy gave us all the instructions in chinese to give to the cab driver. 
The subway is 5-10 minutes away, you'll find some restaurants in the neighbourhood they isn't much else. At least the area is not too noisy during the night. 
The bathroom in our room has a little smell problem, as these kind of buildings did not used to have showers and stuff but everything is clean and you can be assured to have your hot shower. 
I would definitely recommand this place and these hosts for a stay in Beijing as a taste of traditionnal housing, lovely and homey. 
"
128496,"If I could rate my stay for more than 5 stars, I would!  Cindy and Nik are the best hosts I have ever had!  Truly a fun and engaging (Website hidden by Airbnb) hospitable I felt as if I were somehow taking advantage of them (but no, they're just_that_awesome_).

The room was great.  Large and *heated* (very important in the cold months).  I didn't spend a ton of time in the room due to my short stay, but I slept great and had plenty of space to move around.

I'd be crazy to not stay here again when I'm next in Beijing!"
128496,"Cindy and Niko were such a great host, sometimes we forgot that we had just met them.  They made us feel so much at home it almost felt that we've known each other for a long time.  Enjoyed the chats with Cindy and Niko.  My husband wanted to try staying at a hutong and he wasn't disappointed.  The place is clean and if it were only warmer (since we came to Beijing during winter) we would have spent a lot of time in the courtyard.

Cindy even helped us book a driver for the day to go to the great wall.  This was a great help for us.

Would definitely recommending their place if you would llke to stay at a clean hutong style of accommodation in Beijing.  Good recommended restaurants nearby too."
128496,"Cindy is basically your best possible scenario in Beijing- she's wicked funny, has the inside scoop on just about anything with a balanced perspective on living in Beijing. Her husband and her are the most gracious, responsible and hospitable hosts I have ever met.

I especially appreciated the little details like bottled water, toiletries, tissues, etc. My room (and that bed) was super comfortable, and I slept  warm and toasty in freezing Beijing. This courtyard experience is such an amazing urban respite- it was always luxuriously quiet and peaceful there.

I count it my good fortune to have chanced upon this absolute gem. I'll be back!
"
128496,"Cindy and Nicholas, have the BEST bnb ever!! 

From your first contact with Cindy she will make you feel so at ease and relaxed about traveling in Beijing, she will give you all the information you will need to make your trip easy and stress free.

I was made to feel absolutely at home, nothing was to hard for Cindy.  She helped me find places around Beijing, came with me places, organised my next leg of my travels, and was more like a sister than a host. 

 It was so wonderful to just chill in the hutong, to watch DVDs in bed, late breakfasts before going out exploring, I just had the best and most relaxing time there.  My room was so comfortable, my bed was great and it was so good to crank the heater up to compensate for the snow (and to dry my washing too).    

Nicholas's sense of humour will have you laughing from the moment you arrive till the moment you leave.

This is such a great BnB you will never regret staying here, in fact you will ask why you never made this journey before."
128496,"This was, without a doubt, the best Airbnb experience I have had yet...and I've used the site quite a bit previously.  Cindy was super friendly and responsive -- sending pics/directions beforehand to make sure arrival went smoothly.   The place is in a cool courtyard (be sure to get her to tell stories of the history of her place), centrally located, walking distance from subway line2 and 5, and had warm rooms even in December.  As a host, Cindy is always helpful and makes you feel completely at home (and is full of great stories).  She also arranged a day-trip to the Wall for us, packing us lunches with containers for tea.  Can't say enough good things about this place.  "
128496,Cindy is a gracious host and has a lovely home that she shares openly with others. Her instant fried noodles are also a hit! 
128496,"Cindy and Nikos are the perfect hosts, so friendly and helpful.  We spent 7 comfortable nights in the clean and cozy courtyard.  Cindy fed us delicious breakfasts each morning, a nice blend of eastern and western foods, and helped us with our daily plans and evening meals.  This is a comfortable and convenient spot from which it is easy to get to all the sights in Beijing."
128496,"Cindy is great. She helped me a lot during the whole trip: planning where to go, how to get there, how much to pay, how to negotiate, etc! 

Her house is well located, not far from train stations and buses. The place is clean, well equipped and new. 

Cindy and her husband are lovely hosts that will offer you a great stay. Highly recommended.
"
128496,"Cindy's courtyard room in the heart of Beijing is a great value. We  found the room to be exactly  as advertised  and greatly enjoyed the that we were in a real residential neighborhood that was easy to navigate, near many tourist sites,  and  close to the subway. The room was clean and warm- very important in winter in Beijing!  Cindy and her husband Nicholas were great hosts. "
128496,My family and I had a great time at Cindy's.  She is an excellent host with a lot of knowledge about the area.  She gave us some great recommendations on places to eat and helped us with all our reservations.  She also made some great breakfast dishes that were much appreciated.  The room is very comfortable and warm.  The showers had more than enough hot water for three people (it was the middle of winter). The place is also central to many things in Beijing.  I would stay there again the next time we visit again.
128496,"My boyfriend and I went to Beijing to celebrate his 30th birthday and our stay with Cindy was wonderful! 

She met us out on the street very early in the morning (about 6am) and took us to our room. The room was warm, cozy and very clean. There was a breakfast room where we were able to go and make ourselves something to eat each morning which was very handy.

The location of this place is perfect, with my new favourite dumpling restaurant of all time right down the street (where Cindy had to write out our order for us as no English is spoken there).

Unfortunately, we only got to stay with Cindy for 2 days as she was all booked out but if we went back to Beijing, we know for sure where we would be staying! Luckily, we snuck in a last minute lunch with Cindy and Niko before we left and we hope cross paths with them both again one day.

I highly recommend staying here - with Cindy's expertise, it will definitely improve your trip to Beijing!"
128496,"Cindy is awesome!  The whole experience was very special.  I highly recommend staying here.  It was super clean and comfortable!

"
128496,"We stayed with Cindy again on a return to Beijing before heading back to the US.  It felt like coming home!  We had a different room, which was just as lovely.  We talked over meals about the other places we had visited in China.  Cindy gave us tips for getting bargains at the market on our last day, and she even ordered dinner for us!  We look forward to staying with Cindy when we return to Beijing another time!"
128496,"We only had one night to spend here, and then we moved on to a more traditional hotel that our family had picked, but I wish that we had all just stayed at this lovely place for our whole trip. We had a wonderful time talking with Cindy, she pointed us to great food in the neighborhood, and the whole experience was like staying with a good friend with a lovely, comfortable home. A real Beijing treasure. Everyone who really wants to get to know Beijing should stay in the old hutong neighborhoods. I hope I have the chance to go back."
128496,"My stay at Cindy and Nick's in Beijing was really great, and they were the perfect hosts-warm, kind and generous. My accommodation was both cozy and comfortable and surpassed my expectations. I have nothing but praise for Cindy and Nick. Thanks for making my stay in Beijing so enjoyable."
128496,"Thanks for your very warm wellcome, for the pizza and wine and for organizing a perfect excursion to the great wall.

The Location is great, old part still not destroyed by the local authorities. Rebuilt old Chinese style house. Room really big with 3 showers!!! And small bath. Great bed, Internet in the room wifi, phone provided if need to call Cindy!! 

Only minus: towels did not smell fresh!! Maybe local laundry very poor?

Will return

Michel "
128496,"What a great place to stay for a real chinese experience!    I really enjoyed getting to know Cindy and Nicolas and they were great hosts.    Personally I think they should charge more as you not only get a great place to stay, you also get tips on where to dine, directions, etc."
128496,I stayed at cindy's place two weeks ago in Beijing. She is a wonderful host with alot of experiences and very thoughtful advice.  My very best friends and I had a great time at Great Wall because of Cindy's arrangement. Many thanks! 
128496,"Had a great time with Cindy and Nico in March of 2012. If you want to live in genuine old beijing style houses, this is it. Great for families and couples, and super convenient to the subway lines and the airport express (key if youre using beijing as a base for traveling like we did). Cindy is really knowledgeable about beijing and where to go for anything,  and they have an extra cell phone for guests to use should they get lost (their number is preset on speed dial!)

Would definitely recommend."
128496,"Staying at Cindy's was an absolute pleasure. I booked my stay at the recommendation of a friend. I am so thankful he recommended Cindy's quaint, peaceful Beijing retreat. Cindy's B&B was clean, spacious, and comfortable. Though the city was right at our doorstep, Cindy's B&B felt like an absolute haven - a piece of home half-way across the world. Cindy was incredibly helpful throughout my stay and always present with a listening ear. It was a pleasure coming back each night. I am certain I will be staying at Cindy's again on my next visit to Beijing."
128496,Cindy was a great host and we felt like we got a lot more insight into Bejing than had we stayed at a hotel. Cindy and Nicos were very friendly and full of information! They were very helpful and incredibly accommodating. This was our first experience with airbnb and it was a good one. We'll use it again and that's all thanks to Cindy and Nicos.
128496,"Cindy is a gem!
Beforehand she had sent us plenty of useful info and directions for the taxi driver so it was easy to find her place. It is a beautiful old courtyard house, and has been really lovingly restored. The room was great and had absolutely everything we needed - Cindy is very thoughtful - she is a warm, funny and generous host. You'll definitely make the most of your stay as she has great ideas and advice on navigating the city. We loved the area too, perfect for wandering around and exploring the hutongs.
It was such a pleasure to meet Cindy and Nic, we would love to go back!
"
128496,"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Our stay in Cindy's apartment was simply outstanding. Cindy gave us a super friendly welcome and offered us something to eat right, after our stay in North Korea. The apartment was so clean that you could perform an operation in it. Cindy lives there with her husband Nico, he asked us what we want to eat every night for breakfast, just a super friendly person.
Cindy was able to give us all the important tips to our stay in Beijing and has always written us notes, for example to give to the taxi drivers, who usually speak no English.
I can only say that Cindy made sure that our stay in Beijing has become great and I would always go back to her."
128496,"If you haven't figured it out by the other reviews, staying with Cindy is the best choice you can make in Beijing.  She knows the city better than a hotel concierge, provides everything you could need from restaurant suggestions to shopping tips, and keeps the rooms incredibly comfortable and clean.   Staying with her and nico felt like staying with friends.  This is the LOCAL Beijing experience you can't get anywhere else.  "
128496,"Cindy and Nick are immaculate hosts! we reaally enjoyed our stay and would have extended it if they'd had accommodation available. Cindy was extremely helpful with local informaation and the facilites were clean, comfortable and provided everything we needed. It was great to ave a cellphone and be able to call Cindy when stuck language-wise.  I woudl highly recommend this experience to anyone who is looking for something more authentic. "
128496,"I enjoyed my stay from beginning to end. 

Contact with Cindy was easy, quick reponse to mails, very clear instructions on how to reach the place. Accomodation was very good, and well located in what remains of old Bejing, not too far from metro. Being located in the NW of the forbidden city, it is close to Drum Tower, Bei Hai, Lama Temple, which have remained very lively. 

This was the first time I was returning to China having having worked in Sichuan 35 years ago. I had old photos of that stay. I was able to share them with Cindy, who loves her city, and is very knowledgeable about it. This helped me make the best of the three days we spent in Beijing. Also, 

Cindy was very helpful in planning trips to places outside Beijing (Great Wall, Ming tums, Summer palace), and in providing information required for visa applications.

Cindy provided us with a local phone, which proved very useful in our dealings with our driver. 

If I return to Beijing, I will definitely try to stay at Cindy's again."
128496,"This is an amazing little gem, tucked away in one of the old hutong alleys in central Beijing. Cindy was a great host and always good for a laugh. The pictures are very accurate by the way and there is some nice artwork at display in the courtyard. Would always go back if i have the chance. "
128496,"Cindy was simply great, everything was perfect. She made our stay so easy, being there anytime to help us. The room, the place was so nice, and really clean. It was nice coming back ""home"" in the evening to our small paradise in the middle of Peking! It was also really good located, very close to a subway station. Me and my friend really enjoyed our stay at her place, which was our first experience with airbnb. Thanks a lot, dear Cindy, we highly recommend your place."
128496,"Being my first airbnb experience, anywhere I say from now on has a lot to live up to thanks to Cindy and Nico.

Cindy was so amazingly helpful and accommodating, that I can't imagine staying anywhere else the next time I visit Beijing. I came in on the Trans-Siberian Railway and, rather than letting me get ripped off on the short taxi ride, she met me at the station. I was so appreciative that she gave up part of her day to make sure I got to her home safely and efficiently. I was also pleasantly surprised by the wireless access. I think when I booked, the description said only wired access was available. Anyway, I was happy :)

The location is perfect, the house itself is more lovely than the photos and gives you a real feel for being in a real neighborhood. I could have booked in some anonymous fancy hotel, but I'm thankful I found Cindy and Nico's place because the Marriott or Hilton can't manufacture such charm. 

The taxi card she provided got my friend to her place perfectly, the photos and directions she provided were perfect. It can be a bit intimidating going to a new city (especially if you have poor Chinese language skills, like I do), but getting from the subway to her place is a simple walk of two blocks and a left turn, walking almost to the other end of the alley. Maybe 10 minutes, total. It couldn't be more simple!

Cindy and Nico are great. After a few minutes, you instantly feel like they're long lost friends and you feel like you've found your second home."
128496,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was superb! Cindy was an excellent host, provided everything you can think of - great breakfasts, snacks, a hundred varieties of tea, toiletries and even a mobile phone. She has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable. The best part was hearing her stories, she definitely gives some candid insights into Chinese culture, which is a breath of fresh air if you have had any dealings in China. I just so enjoyed speaking with Cindy, I wish I had more time to absorb her perspectives, she has a lot to share. Definitely recommend her to any visitor in Beijing. Oh and the courtyard house experience is a must in Beijing, this is luxurious by hutong standards and the rooftop is awesome too."
128496,"we loved our stay with cindy - i wouldn't hesitate to refer anyone to her place....the location was great - the communication was great; everything was clean; cindy and nick were both very helpful in helping us plan our stay....

we'd stay there again.

thanks for making our trip to beijing that much more enjoyable.

eric & aj."
128496,"I spent 5 days in Beijing and stayed with Cindy and Nick! They were absolutely wonderful and welcoming hosts. They were always ready for a friendly chat and always had some fun stories to share! The room was huge and clean, the courtyard inviting and the fridge always filled with delicious goodies to be had for snack or breakfast. A five-star experience!
Thanks guys! "
128496,"Cindy is a very nice host, has plenty of good advices when you arrive! She has a very good sens of humour. She let me use the washer to get my laundry done before I left for hiking on the great wall (also left me two spirals against mosquitos and advices to fight against badgers). Very cool host!! "
128496,"Cindy is a most remarkable person with a good sense of humor and a sarcastical understanding of the political situation in China. Talking to her was the best part of our trip to Beijing. In her house you can feel at home and also get a good feeling for the town. Her husband who is greek helped us to more understanding of the daily life in China. The descriptions to get to Cindy house were perfect. The room is comfortable and clean. You can use a common kitchen and stay in the yard. We really hope to see these guys again and have another bottle of wine together. 
"
128496,We spent a very pleasant 2 days with Cindy. The room and outdoor courtyards were beautiful and immaculate. Great wifi access was an unexpected surprise. Most of all we enjoyed animated conversations with Cindy and her husband. Cindy was extremely helpful to us in navigating the city.
128496,"Thanks Cindy and Nico for your warm hospitality! Had a great time. The accommodations were the best I had in my 3-week trip to China. Clean, comfortable and air conditioned! The location was wonderful. Easy access to the sites by taxi or subway and very interesting to just stroll around the neighbourhood. Cindy was extremely helpful in every way... directions, restaurants, general advice, setting up a driver for the great wall, lending a cell phone and more. Also, really enjoyed Cindy's insight into China and a wide range of other topics! Would highly recommend this place as a home away from home. Thanks!!! "
128496,Cindy was extremely helpful and a very kind person and her husband too. They are great!Her house is the perfect place to stay in Beijing. No doubts in recommending it.
128496,"Cindy is amazing. She's incredibly helpful, right from the moment you book her place until you climb into the cab when you leave. She's immensely knowledgeable, speaks great English, and has an amazing, beautiful, and tranquil escape in the midding of Beijing. Highly, highly recommended!"
128496,"It was a very good and unique experience to be at Cindy's place! Thanks to her and Nikos we finally had a taxi driver to the airport, not easy to find one in Beijing... Their place is really  nice, quite and they really helped us to visit and behave in Beijing . We highly recommand this place to stay."
128496,"As you can tell from other reviews Cindy's place great and all of them are right. It is a great place to relax in after a day on the streets of Beijing- sharing a beer and a story. From the location to the advice, the whole stay is the best I've had with air BnB. Its a fantastic chance to experience Beijing and would plan around staying there next time. Thanks once more!"
128496,"the stay at cindy's house was the best stay we've ever had with airbnb so far! she was very helpful from the very first moment, when we booked the rooms and gave us a lot of information in advance! the room was very clean and big. and the athmosphere around the yard was just great. not just the building and yard itself, but especially the nice chats with her, her husband nik and the other guest we met. it was a very friendly and family-like athmosphere, where you can share stories and beer :) there are also some nice restaurants nearby and you can get around easily with the train and the busses. the stations are not far away. i highly recommend to stay at cindy's place, when you visit beijing!"
128496,"My wife and I stayed in one of Cindy's homes in Beijing.    They have a very nice home which had everything we needed.   The room and bath were neat, clean, and secure/safe.   The location and style provided us a feel of ""Old Beijing"".     We made good use of the Metro (close by) and the area restaurants.     Cindy is very organized and helpful  having provided us with lots of information and observations on life in Bejing.   Great hosts!  Great experience!       "
128496,"I stayed with Cindy during the week long holiday when everyone in China is on vacation and people swarm Beijing. Not a smart move on my part but she made it absolutely painless. From the moment I booked until the moment I stepped out on my last day she held my little baby travel hand; helping me with my visa application, providing unbelievably detailed directions to her place (supplemented with photos!) and hanging out with a lonely traveler.

Cindy is definitely not just some person out there trying to make a buck with her totally awesome property. She and her husband, Nick, really welcome people as guests in their home. She preps you with a survival guide upon booking and provides a stack of useful information upon arrival. She even included a printout with subway station closures specifically for the holiday week. Who does that?! And if that isn't enough, she's always available in person for questions and even gives you a phone for SOS calls while you're out and about.

On top of being a fantastic host, Cindy's also an uber cool person, very easy to talk to and highly entertaining. She and Nick create a very inclusive environment encouraging people to mingle - like a youth hostel but without the noise and communal bathrooms. If there were any guests around at dinner time they always asked if they wanted to join which was nice for me as a solo traveler. However, this doesn't mean that they're always in your face. I'm sure that people wanting more space would get just that.

Casa de Cindy and Nick was definitely the best part of my stay in Beijing."
128496,"Cindy was very knowledgeable about Beijing and helpful. We enjoyed her company; she even saved us when we got lost! We had wanted to stay in a traditional Chinese style home and are glad that we got to do that. Our room was large, well furnished, and quite comfortable!  "
128496,"Whenever you come to Beijing, please do not book a hotel, but stay at Cindy's house. She really cares for her guests and I enjoyed my stay very much. My room was very comfortable and lovely. You can have contact to her other guests which were very friendly too. To stay at Cindy's, you'll have a great China experience. Thank you!!! Bye Oliver"
128496,"My girlfriend and I stayed 4 nights at Cindy's smaller room inside her inner courtyard mid to late October. My girlfriend tends to do thorough research online before deciding where to stay and she was smitten with Cindy's place on Airbnb even prior to our stay. From my point of view, the house, as well as Cindy and Nick's hospitality, really did live up to their Airbnb reputation and our expectations.

The courtyard inside the traditional Beijing hutong is easily accessible from streets. It's also near the major subway lines to get to tourist spots. The neighborhood felt safe and I think it's quite foreigner-friendly (the entire Beijing city is very open to laowai nowadays).

Our room was clean and comfortable. All the furniture and lighting fixture was tastefully arranged. Shower and bathroom were Westerner-friendly and the heat lamps in the shower really helped as it could get very cold in this part of the courtyard. There's also two heavy-duty electric heaters inside the bedroom to keep the bedroom warm at night.

The much-reviewed, legendary ""Breakfast Room"" was well-stocked and a must-go hangout for everyone. We had several inspiring chats about China and its culture there with Cindy, her husband Nick and some other fellow guests.

In addition, Cindy invited us to dinner at an awesome local diner (with peking duck) a couple minutes walk from her house and it cost only 50 kuai each person (about US$8). Cindy also organized Taichi (traditional Chinese workout routine) and Chinese pastry lessons to keep her guests entertained and inspired.

Overall, the 5 days and 4 nights went by fast but we really felt plugged into the local culture and had an authentic Beijing experience. I truly admire Cindy's energy, resourcefulness, and Nick's wits and knowledge, and his dry humor (which I notice every reviewer has pointed out :)

"
128496,"Cindy was an amazing host. With only one full day in Beijing, we had a lot to do and she met us at the house and ran through the best itinerary for us. She also gave us a local cellphone and organised a driver for us so we could visit the Great Wall. She is super friendly and helpful, and made sure we had an amazing stay.

It was great to stay in a traditional courtyard set up, and the house was very traditional, spacious and clean. We were able to use the kitchen and use milk and bread provided for breakfast :)

Staying in a home down one of Beijing's hutongs gave us a taste of how real life is in the city. As you walk to the house you see men sat together drinking beer and playing Mahjong - lovely to get a feel for the local community and see how people live.

Definitely recommend staying with Cindy if you ever visit Beijing!"
128496,"Cindy was very hepfull even two months ago our trip to China, offering good and usefull advices to get into her country. It was essential at the beginnig of our journey in such a different country.
Her house is lovely, warm, in really good conditions, aircon, heating in the room and with a nice courtyard, good taste decorated and very well located, not far from the ""Forbidden City"". 
She and her friends were very kind whit us, and recommended different places to visit and good and original restaurant to eat. She also help us to contact with local people to visit the Great Wall out of Beijing.
I really reccomend Cindy′s place if you want to stay a few days in Beijing."
128496,"I choose Cindy because of her glowing reviews and she still managed to exceed all of my expectations.    

My time in Beijing was a pleasure in large part due to Cindy's thoughtful preparation for her visitors.  It is amazingly helpful to have her expertise and advice as you make your way through Beijing and to know that her help is only a call away on the cell she provides!  It is also a breath of fresh air to have a host who is really on your side as opposed to many others who are looking to make a buck pushing a particular tour.  I really think my trip to the Jin Shan Ling section of the great wall would have been impossible (or outrageously expensive) with out her help arranging the driver etc.  If you have the time and don't mind the hike, go to Jin Shan Ling!

While I can't say enough about how helpful Cindy was making arrangements for me, it is even more important that I enjoyed her and her husband's company the entire time I was there.  When I am travelling solo, I am always looking for exciting and interesting people to share stories and spend time with.  Even the early season snow didn't put a damper on my excitement for Beijing because it meant a great morning shooting the breeze with Cindy and Nick.  

Rooms were clean, comfortable and spacious.  I spent very little time in my room as the breakfast area and courtyard are great places to spend your downtime.  Breakfast was simple and tasty and filtered water, tea and cookies were always available.  Maps, tips on restaurants and directions to local attractions were provided, and were accurate.     Don't hesitate to stay here!  "
128496,"A perfect haven for weary travellers. Cindy is a natural, delightful host and very thoughtful. I will definitely be returning to this well furnished and warm, cozy environment. The architecture and decor have a personal yet professional touch, with modern conveniences blended into a traditional setting. "
128496,"We stayed in Cindy's lovely B&B for five nights and explored Beijing from here. Cindy was extremely helpful (we got our own mobile phone to call her in emergencies, she organised our trip to the Great Wall and she helped with making itineraries for the day). Best of all, our room was cozy and warm amid outside temperatures of -5/-10 degrees. Thanks so much for making our stay so nice."
128496,"Great authentic place.
We are a young couple and stayed 9 days in Beijing. Although it was freezing cold, our room was very warm and we loved it very much. Even in the shower we found a heating lamp which made it comfortable to take a shower. Cindy is a great host as she really cares about her guests and has a lot of good traveling advices. Her hints are of high value, e.g. make also sure that you follow her instructions for putting bleaching supplies into the toilet that it does not smell. However, sleeping room was perfect and we definitely recommend this authentic place.
"
128496,"A visit to Bejing would not be the same without meeting Cindy and spending a few nights at her wonderful Oasis in this busy city.  It was the little things that Cindy provided that made the experience 5 star.  Coffee and snacks in the breakfast room make you feel like you are at home.  Her precise details make navigating Beijing like a walk in the park.  The room was so cozy and warm when it was -6 C outside you couldn't want  anything more.  But the best part of staying here was chatting with Cindy in the morning, sharing some great dinners together with her and Nick.  She is truly a unique person; who with her experience of meeting many different people from all over the world has the ability to make you feel so welcomed and at home when you are with her.  We are currently staying in a hotel this evening in Xian and wish Cindy was here with us.  After traveling the world for the past 20 years, this visit to Bejing and staying with Cindy is in my top 5.  Thanks again for an amazing time."
128496,"Cindy is an amazing host! she think at all you need, and even more. I don't have never seen a person as him, sweety, kindly, all in him is goodness. And his home is really quiet and peaceful. Go on!"
128496,"Cindy and Nick are awesome.  Their place is incredible and it was a pleasure to meet them. Leading up to and throughout my stay, Cindy was a gracious and super helpful host.  All in all, I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Beijing. I couldnt have asked for a better expierence, I only wish it was for longer.  "
128496,Cindy's courtyard is a fantastic place to stay. I highly recommend it! Cindy is a gracious host. She recommended a lot of secret local spots in Beijing. I learned so much about Chinese history and culture thanks to Cindy's stand-up comedy routine. She will fill your stay with laughter and good-spirited fun. A truly comfortable and warm stay in the middle of a chilly winter in Beijing. I cannot wait to return. 
128496,"Staying with Cindy and Nick was like visiting family.  My girlfriend and I stayed with them for 5 nights and made a habit of gathering in the kitchen in the morning for coffee, stories, ideas, and plenty of laughter. 

The place was Cool...situated in an energetic neighborhood alley, with a nice courtyard, not far from Line 2 and Line 5 of the Subway.  Perfect for someone interested in conveniently getting to Beijing's main historical attractions.  The room itself was large, clean, and well heated.  Oh, and the shower had HOT water!

Cindy was very knowledgable about the goings on in Beijing and was very helpful if we had questions.  We had a fantastic experience in China and I highly recommend staying with Cindy.  

"
128496,"Cindy is the best. Seriously. Beijing can be a hard place to navigate and can be a very different (but worthwhile!) experience for a lot of people. Cindy will help you avoid paying too much for tours and souvenirs and avoid scams (very important). She will make you feel comfortable and at home in her lovely abode and will help you out with anything else you could possibly need. 
Short walk to subway and really really good food ( Peking Duck! Mmmm).
"
128496,"Cindy is amazing. She is the best guide of Beijing and the Chinese culture. Every morning at breakfast she informs you about the best ways to explore the city.
Our stay in this historical house in the heart of Beijing was a great experience, because you really felt how it is living as a Chinese. The rooms are convenient with a lot of space, warm and cozy (for Dutch people cozy = important ;-)
The service was extraordinary. Example: we got a local phone for free (for Dutch people free = important ;-) And even the beer was for free.
Overall: great experience, the best place to be (for Dutch people best = important ;-)
 "
128496,"Cindy's place is an enchanting getaway in the middle of, yet tucked away from, the hustle and bustle of the city. I came on a business trip and only stayed one night, but enjoyed Cindy's company, hospitality, and recommendations on the hidden gems for feasting and craft beer watering holes in the neighborhood alleys. Cindy's charming courtyard dwellings have all the comforts of a 5-star hotel and more, but none of the boredom. Highly recommended!"
128496,I really loved to stay in Cindy's Hutong! It's nice to be home in a huge city you've never been to before! She and her husband know everything a newbie has to know and are above all very open and friendly people! THANKS!
128496,"Cindy's house in Beijing was wonderful to stay at.  It's super convenient (subway and bus lines nearby, grocery stores and food available close as well), and in a good area.  It is an excellent choice if you're staying in Beijing!

Cindy and Nick are fantastic hosts, helpful in finding interesting things to see and do.  Cindy's guide to the area and what to watch out for in China is not to be missed!"
128496,"All the good reviews for Cindy and Nick don't even come close to telling you just what wonderful hosts they are. Friendly, informative, funny and extremely welcoming, as a base for exploring Beijing I can't believe there's a better place out there. The location is fantastic, and the house is really convenient for getting about thanks to close proximity to the subway. Add to that the great local atmosphere of the hutong itself and you've got a wonderful spot to immerse yourself in Beijing culture. All of that would mean little without Cindy and Nick. From helpful tips for preparing for China pre-travel, to arranging transport to the Great Wall, I couldn't ask for more, and at this point can't wait to get to back to Beijing just to stop in at Cindy's again...!"
128496,"There are only a few places in airbnb that will give you the great experience of living like you where at home, and Cindy 's house is one of them.
The apartment is in the centre of Beijing, close to the subway and near a lot of lines buses. The room is great, big and comfortable, with the private bathroom and a big shower. Everything very clean and tidy. 
But the bonus of this place is her host!! Cindy is amazing! She helps you in whatever you need. Since you are in a city where people do not speak English, Cindy and his husband Nick became the most precious help, not only in what to do or where to go, also in helping you to arrange a service. All her advises where right, she even arrange for us a trip to the Great Wall, and it was amazing! If you are going to Beijing you must go to Cindy 's place you won't regret!!
"
128496,"Cindy is clearly an awesome host who has put a lot of thought into creating a great guest experience at her amazing property. Some specific examples:

1. Upon our arrival in the house, Cindy sat down with us, learned about the purpose of our visit, and gave us a list of options for nearby entertainment and dining
2. Cindy also provided us with full access to the goodies in her kitchen for breakfast the next morning (including her private stash of Vegemite!)
3. The accommodations are well thought out - sample-sized toiletries are provided in the bathroom and Beijing tour guides and books for leisure reading line the bookshelf in the bedroom 
4. During our visit, Nik was working hard to install magnetic mosquito screens on all of the doors to let the air into each room while keeping bugs out - clearly they are always working hard to improve the experience!
5. Most importantly, the hutong itself is beautiful and incredibly well preserved (and as a Beijing native, I have seen quite a few) - if you do get the chance to visit, don't forget to ask Cindy to tell you the history of the place so you know exactly what a privilege it is to be staying in such a historically rich house!"
128496,"Our stay with Cindy was an absolute highlight of our trip to China. From the moment we booked our accommodation (6 months before our stay!) Cindy was kind and helpful, with everything from planning our trip to the Great Wall to the directions to her lovely home. The location is perfect in the heart of Beijing down a wonderful Hutong, where we got to experience everyday life. Cindy's property is beautiful and it is tucked away and quiet, even though it is in the middle of such a large city. The rooms are spacious, the sitting area in the courtyard is charming, and the breakfast room is the perfect place for a morning chat. 
Cindy and Nick are wonderful hosts who take a lot of pride in what they do. Cindy provides information about all the best restaurants in the area as well as transportation information for all of the popular tourist sites. Cindy was always available when we had questions and concerns and our stay with her added life and character to our trip in Beijing. We couldn't imagine staying anywhere else, especially not an impersonal hotel. 

Thanks for everything Cindy and Nick!"
128496,"Cindy and Nick were fabulous hosts. We hit it off with Cindy from the moment we arrived. She was very helpful in helping us, and other guests get around. We shared many many laughs together in our short stay, and would recommend anyone stay here. The atmosphere of their well decorated, homey Chinese hutong home was a paradise to retreat to from the dirty, busy, crowded Beijing experience. Having some breakfast items and coffee available was a brilliant change from a previously negative AirBnB experience in Shanghai."
128496,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here with Cindy and Nick.  My husband kept on saying ""I'm so glad you booked us to stay at hutong"".  And this is one great hutong!  It is centrally located within ""ring 2"" of the subway line and easily accessible to so many sites. Cindy is incredibly helpful with all of her lists (how to get to X, restaurant maps and reviews).  She's always there and ready to help if you need it but also allows you to be a more independent traveler if that's your style. Plus, she has such interesting guests that it is fun to chat with others at the end of the day or before you start your day over breakfast.  The accommodations are exactly as advertised: neat, clean, and a quiet oasis amidst a bustling city.  Being able to do laundry during our trip was also a big plus!  Highly recommend!"
128496,"Staying at Cindy's place was a very pleasant experience. Cindy and Nick are very good hosts, friendly, fun, and willing to help you get around Beijing. They were willing to accomodate us as best as they could and everything felt like staying at our own place.
Thank you guys! "
128496,"We had a wonderful experience staying at Cindy's. She is an incomparable host: an experienced traveller with a good perspective on the cultural differences and a detail oriented host. We had even more comfort than in a 5 stars hotel: which hotel gives you a cellphone for the day in case of need or question ? Which hotel offers 10 international power plugs in the room ?She's funny, always smiling and knows everything. If i come back to Beijing i  will definitely stay there again."
128496,"The world should thank Cindy because without her, I am sure that many people would not have the opportunity to visit Beijing on a budget while having a very pleasant experience. Cindy's place is traditional with modern comforts. The shower is unique and clean, and the room is spacious and clean as well. If you do your laundry there, your clothes will smell wonderful. I appreciate the time she took to map out our short stay in Beijing and her attentiveness to emails leading up to our visit.  She made things super easy with her driver, who is reliable and helpful.  I really couldn't have asked for a better time in Beijing. My sister and I thought our time there exceeded out expectations.  You must stay here!"
128496,"Cindy and Nikos are helpful and humorous hosts who provide a green, quiet oasis in which to take a relaxing break from the hurried hubbub of bustling Beijing. They provide DVDs for adults as well as children, instructions on how to get where you want to go anywhere in Beijing or even Tibet, and a packet full of helpful tips about local customs and local scams to avoid. The central location was convenient, the price excellent for the quality.
Rooms were clean, cool, and furnished with everything one might need. Bath rooms had plenty of hot water and western amenities.
The open kitchen had everything for a basic breakfast or afternoon snack, such as peanut butter sandwiches for the kids and beer for the adults. 
I would happily stay there again when I next return to Beijing!"
128496,"The best place I can think of to stay in Beijing and feel like home. The location couldn't be better, the house is wonderfull: you will find and oasis of quietness in the middle of Beijing's caos. Rooms are very big and apotless.  And what can I say of Cindy and Nikos? They are the perfect hosts, made us feel very confortable and shared all their knowledge about the city and the country.... We laughed a lot too, they are a lot of fun!!!"
128496,Our stay with Cindy and Nic was a great local experience. Cindy's kitchen is a great place for a worldly chat lol..It made our Beijing holiday more personal thank you xx
128496,Great spot. A calm oasis in the craziness of Beijing. Cindy and Nick were great host and made sure we were comfortable. Recommended. 
128496,We had such a great time staying at Cindy and Nicks place. Spacious room with AC that kept us cool during the hot summer days. Cindy recommended restaurants in the area and arranged the perfect trip to the Great Wall. Highly recommended!
128496,"Cindy's Courtyard is a nice and welcomed change from cold and impersonal 5 star hotels. Cindy, Nick and Cindy's mom are very warm, friendly and humorous. They made us feel right at home. The common kitchen which came well stocked with fruits, coffee, a variety of tea, cold drinks and beer was great after a day out in the hot sun. The room is clean, large and well thought out. We had a great time in Beijing, thanks to our fantastic hosts!!!"
128496,"Cindy and Nick were great!  They were such gracious hosts, who gave us the best insider knowledge of Beijing.  I loved joining them every morning in the breakfast area for snacks and tea.

The room itself was exactly as pictured in the listing.  The courtyard was so charming and relaxing--it truly is a peaceful getaway from the hustle and bustle of Beijing!  It's a great way to enjoy the city!"
128496,Cindy was really helpful and was always available to help with anything. The house was spotless and comfortable. The chinese cell phone provided was a real plus. It was centrally located and we could easily get to all sights from there.
128496,"We had a very nice time at the place of Cindy and Nick. Situated in a traditional Hutong, it is a peaceful spot with its lovely apartments, the nice garden and it’s amazing roof terraces in the busy city Beijing. Most of the sights of Beijing can be easily reached with the subway which is closed by. Cindy and Nick are amazing and helpful hosts. We had the chance to spend some time together and had a really nice time. Cindy organized a very nice trip for us to the Great Wall to a location where it was really not overcrowded."
128496,"Amazing location, Amazing place, and Amazing hosts, what more than you ask for! Oh and one more thing, Cindy's survival guide pretty much made the whole trip near perfect, make sure you damn well read it if you want your Beijing trip sorted! The world needs more people like Cindy and Nikos! Thank you Airbnb for allowing me to meet such amazing people!"
128496,"Trust the raving reviews! We stayed there for 4 nights in early September and thoroughly enjoyed Cindy's place.
Particular highlights : 
- the place is in a traditional hutong, well renovated and very charming
- excellent location, close to the city center
- Cindy and Nick are extremely available and helpful - definitely follow their advice regarding visits, restaurants and practical life.
All in all, we would definitely recommend this place! It provides excellent value for your RMB!"
128496,"We had an amazing time staying with Cindy and Nick during our four days in Beijing. Throughout the whole process from booking to arrival, our time there and departure, Cindy was always immediately responsive and helpful.

The accommodation was very spacious and comfortable, and had access to the kitchen and laundry amenities in the common areas. With two security entrances it's also very secure. 

Upon our arrival we were given maps and a guide to the local neighborhood so we were able to take care of food and shopping all within a 5-10 minute walk if needed. 

The location is very convenient and is within the inner areas of the city. Visitors get to experience an authentic Chinese neighborhood and way of life but with familiar western conveniences. 

With subway stations around 10 minutes walk (tops) in two directions you are perfectly situated to visit the city's tourist landmarks. 

The view from the terrace is beautiful, and ideal for spotting local cats if that's your thing :)

We'd definitely recommend this place for any visitors to Beijing!"
128496,"The apartment was very comfortable. The yard and terrace were so wonderful and provided a nice respite from Beijing's crowds. The location is central and wonderful restaurants and bars are within walking distance. Cindy and Nick were amazing hosts. Not only did they arrange a car to take us to their secret part of the Great Wall, they also regaled us with anecdotes about Chinese culture. Cindy is easy to reach by phone and happily answers any question you might have. The shared kitchen is stocked with beer, coffee, tea, fruit, toast, and Cindy's homemade goodies. "
128496,"If you want to experience the real China , this is the place to stay tucked away in a typical suburban area of Beijing.
Very close to transport and all the usual sights. 
 Clean, comfortable and safe.
good WiFi
Nick, the other part of the Combo is great bloke, cannot do enough for you, very thoughtful "
128496,Great place to stay in Beijing. Puts you right into an atmospheric hutong area. Cindy and Nick are lovely hosts. They are very generous and great with kids. 
128496,"So great! We had a wonderful time in Beijing, thanks to Cindy and Nick. The room was very nice, the house is really fantastic, a peaceful, recreative space in the midst of a loud and crowded city. We enjoyed meeting other travellers in the kitchen and exchanging experiences. Most of all, Cindy and Nick were very helpful, gave us tips, helped us organize trips and tickets and were always fun to talk to. We definitely come back!"
128496,"Maison très bien située,au calme, dans un hutong au centre de Pékin, ce qui permet de découvrir les modes de vie dans leur diversité. La chambre, spacieuse, confortable et agréable, des sanitaires tout à fait convenables. Nous avons apprécié la mise à disposition de la cuisine pour le petit déjeuner, compris dans la prestation, ou un petit en cas à toute heure de la journée.

Cindy est un h?te sympathique, disponible et prête à donner informations, bons conseils, bonnes adresses, entre-autre, la liste des petits restau du coin intéressante.

Nous recommandons"
128496,"Beautiful place in a great location.  Cindy and Nick are perfect hosts.  Very friendly and informative when you want them to be, but perfectly able to respect your privacy and space.  Wonderful choice, great people."
128496,"Warm and witty, a wonderful host in all ways!

Staying with Cindy and Nic in their place was the best way to begin our trip through China. Their place really is in the heart of Beijing, in a very genuine alleyway neighbourhood. A short walk to the Subway, or even shorter walk to a main street with Taxis aplenty. 

Supermarkets nearby and you pretty much have to go to the dumpling place round the corner, awesome :)

The room was excellent, comfortable and clean. A great breakfast room has tea, coffee, toast and snacks (and beer!)

But you know what makes a place, people. A variety of guests come and go, always someone to chat with, this is a popular spot for good reason. And of course, Cindy and Nic, we laughed so much while hanging out with them in the morning or evening, like good friends we only just met. 

Do yourselves a favour, make this your stay in Beijing!"
128496,"Cindy nous a réservé un bl'on accueil.
Avant le séjour, elle nous a envoyé un ""guide de survie"" détaillé avec toutes les infos nécessaires pour notre séjour à Pekin.
A l arrivée, elle nous a mis à dispo un mobile avec une carte sim chinoise. Ce qui permet de la contacter si besoin ou de tel nos amis qui étaient déjà sur place.
Les logements sont très bien situés et bien équipés.
Un frigo invité est à disposition avec tout ce qui faut pour un petit déjeuner rapide et des bières locales pour l apéro.

Une bonne alternative si l'on veut voyager chez l'habitant!"
128496,"We had a very pleasant stay at Cindy's appartment. Everything from airport pickup, which Cindy arranged for us, trips to the Chinese Wall, tipps how to get along, the appartment itself worked perfectly for us. If you are looking for an authentic Chinese Hutong experience in a Siheyuan (traditional Chinese yard house), then this is what you should go for. If you are looking for a posh luxury place, then this is not what you are looking for. Cindy and her husband Nick were very nice chatting partners from whom I learned a lot about China, Chinese culture, society and people. I can say it was the most interesting China experience I ever had. Both of them are very kind and fun to hang out with (which we did acompanied by a bottle of wine). I hope to see them again and wish everybody who chooses Cindy's appartment a wonderful time there!!
George"
128496,"Me and my two kids had a great time at Cindy's place. Everything was all well organized. We got picked up at the airport. Cindy also organized a trip by car to the great wall and tickets to an acrobatic show. She gave recommendations for shopping in the area. Her house was also close to many main attractions, situated in a hutong area, where it was peaceful and quiet. "
128496,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Cindy's nice place! It was perfectly located, with plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. It is a traditional chinese residence, modernized with indoor plumbing and bathing. I particularly enjoyed the courtyard in a sunny day! Cindy and Nick are nice hosts, very friendly. It has really been a pleasure to stay at their place. We will surely stay there again if we visit Beijing in the future. Highly recommended."
128496,"We had a wonderful stay at Cindy's!
She was extremely helpful in suggesting things to go see, and most importantly, how to get there. The airport taxi pickup was also of great help! The rooms are clean, large and nicely decorated. Could not have asked for anything more.

Plenty of toast and beer.
Thank you Cindy! It was great chatting with you and Nic about Beijing."
128496,"The place to stay in Beijing!
Cindy's place located in a old traditional Chinese quarter and is an old building that has been nicely renovated. The rooms were spacious and equipped with everything you need. Even a little DVD collection if you just feel like relaxing after a freezing Beijing winter day. The little courtyard and the deck that allow you to climb on top of the houses and are the perfect hangout to enjoy a cup of coffee (even in the winter).
Cindy is a great host and has everything perfectly organized. Before you get to Beijing she will provide you with all the information needed and also give some cultural advice on what to expect (If you have never been to China and start your trip in Beijing it is exceptionally helpful).
She also provides a detailed map on the surroundings, a tourist map of Beijing and an explanation how to reach the main sights. Cindy also provides everything for breakfast toast, coffee and tea. For more traditional Chinese rice soup or bāozi you can probably find outside the block.
The metro is only five minutes away so that all the sights are within reach and getting there from the Airport with 75RMB is very easy. 
Clearly a unique place to stay, that we can highly recommend. "
128496,"We both couldn't imagine better hosts than Cindy and Nick. Their little paradise in the middle of downtown Beijing is absolutely unique. Cindy was a great help to make the best out of our time in Beijing. She can also arrange drivers for reasonable prices. If we come back to Beijing, we know where we will stay! "
128496,Cindy and Nic were very friendly and welcoming upon arrival. Cindy was happy to answer our questions about thing we wanted to do which made our trip to Beijing easier. Highly recommended!  
128496,Thanks Cindy and Nick for everything. The room is perfect for our stay. Living in a Hutong among the Beijingers is a great experience. 
128496,"Very cute and authentique! Unfortunately I didn′t meet Cindy personnally but she gave a lot of info. 
The rooftop terrace is great!
I recommend!"
128496,The stay at Cindy's place was perfect. I cannot recommend this one enough.
128496,"We loved staying in Cindy & Nic's hutong! They're wonderful hosts! The guest suite was very toasty and warm despite the cold weather outside (except the toilet seat - frozen buns, anyone?"
128496,"Staying with Cindy and Nick was a wonderful experience! Not only do you get to stay in wonderful surroundings, in the middle of a traditional hutong, you also get to experience the hospitality and warmness of the hosts.
The rooms were very nice and were equipped with everything you could possibly need: extra heaters, wifi, dvd-player... This was also the most comfortable bed I had slept in in over a year (since I came to China)!
During my next trip to Beijing I will definitely return to Heart of Beijing BnB!"
128496,"Dear Cindy is very kind and warm host!!
The house is very well located, near to several important site and MRT station.
Chinese style decoration, very cute and comfy :D.
Will definitely come back if we travel Beijing again!!"
128496,"This was our first airbnb stay where we actually met our hosts & it made such a difference. Cindy & Nick were incredibly generous, both with their time (endless local knowledge) & supplies (amazing dumplings for breakfast, lava cake & beer to name a few!). Location was good, a short walk from the nearest subway & reasonably close (by Beijing standards!) to the Forbidden City. Cindy organised us a driver for the Great Wall which included lots of little extras which we might not have got elsewhere - it was a really fantastic day. Overall we enjoyed our time there immensely & only wished we could have had longer..thanks again to you both :)"
128496,"Wonderful time here. Quiet courtyard that's in the middle of the city but provides a respite from the business of Beijing. Room and bathroom are great. Cindy was also great, giving detailed information about the surrounding area as well as giving us the opportunity to make traditional Chinese dumplings. Cindy also created a great atmosphere for all of the guests to get to know everyone.
"
128496,"We stayed only for a few days from 15-18 March, arrived at Bejing at 6:30am. Thankful to Cindy for making arrangement with friendly driver Zhang Shifu to meet us at the airport. With 2 big luggages ready for lugging home our shopping (mostly not mine), most local taxi probably wouldn't be able to fit hubby & I in. Chose Cindy's place as I've never stepped foot into a siheyuan before, & I didn't want to stay at yet another hotel. Nik showed us our room, complete with 5 heaters & heating lamps to be used in the shower! No fear of being caught in the cold here! It wasn't too cold when we were here, so we used the heater only to dry our washed clothes.

Spent some good time chatting with Cindy & Nik especially during breakfast. Sweet of Cindy to get non-beef chinese snacks when she knew my hubby doesn't take beef. Love her infectious laughter! And really grateful to Cindy for offering to place orders thru Taobao even before I arrived & time taken to check thru the orders & items. Not sure if she'll still offer her service to others after her experience with mine! I'm the undisputable ""shopping queen""! Under her guidance & directions, we managed to get around Beijing on our own on public buses & taking the subways, which are my preferred mode of transport anyway. The nearest subway is just about 10-15 mins walk away, depending on your pace. Went to several of her recommended eateries nearby too when we didnt want to go far off. 

Met other guests of the house too, Teresa & friends from Malaysia. Regretfully didn't spend much time with them. 

Like how Cindy kept her kitchen opened to guests whole day through, just like your own. Room is definitely big enough for both of us with our luggages & shopping bags. Caught up with a few movies while there with their collection of DVDs. 

Highly recommend Cindy's place if you are looking for a local stay experience! I am quite sure I'll see more of Cindy & Nik again. : )"
128496,"Cindy and Nick were impeccable hosts, and their home was a perfect base for my work trip to Beijing. They even let me have a small meeting in the courtyard. Great location, quiet, pleasant, clean, and lovely traditional decor. Thanks for a great stay!"
128496,"We had a wonderful time staying here! Cindy and Nick were incredibly welcoming, friendly and helpful. Our room was comfortable and had everything we could need. Cindy provided lots of useful information in advance of our trip, and was generous in helping to make some arrangements for us, even for a part of the trip before we were staying with her. We had fun making (and eating!) dumplings. Cindy joined us on a shopping trip to a local market, which was a highlight for our 9-year-old daughter. It was her first trip to a foreign country, and Cindy and Nick made her feel right at home. Don't know when we'll make it back to Beijing, but if we do, we would be so happy to stay here again."
128496,"We found Cindy and Nick's place very easily thanks to their excellent directions.  They were wonderfully welcoming and hospitable and everything we needed for breakfast was there for us. The rooms were large and very comfortable, and we felt very safe. Highly recommended."
128496,"I don't think I can add much to all the previous reviews. This is an extremely nice place, in a great location with some very nice and friendly hosts. One of the best airbnb places I've been to so far."
128496,"We stayed in Cindy's place briefly .
Cindy and partner (sorry I forgot his name) was very kind , place was very comfortable , also I like the neighborhood which is still full of life.
I loved the little courtyard and rooftop terrace.
She is very organized and you can rely on her a lot of things. (transport etc)
I recommend strongly to anyone who want true Beijing experience! 
 "
128496,"Cindy and Nikos were really friendly to us from the moment we arrived ever willing to help and answer questions and, for example, arrange a car to take us to the wall. They went out of their way to make us feel at home. The accommodation was relaxed, comfortable and a really quiet oasis away from the lively, teeming city that is Beijing. Great."
128496,"Cindy informed me on my first query that she would be away while we were in Beijing. I was attracted to her house because of the detail she included and was not disappointed! She emailed me lots of useful info including which local restaurants to frequent (tried two including fab Peking duck place) and clear directions to various sites etc. Cindy also organised a driver to collect us from the airport and when this had to be changed, did so for us from Greece!
The accomodation is quirky but authentic. A little oasis at end of an alley but clear instructions on how to find. Bed comfortable and supplies in communal kitchen very generous. Cindy's mother was very sweet and looked after us very well.
Jennifer and David"
128496,"Cindy's place is perfectly located in Beijing for day and night life. It's really quiet, clean, spacious and well equiped. I loved the terasse which make this place really special. If i come back in Beijing, I will definitly go there again!"
128496,"
Cindy and Nic were such great hosts! I think they are one of the highlights of my Beijing stay. The room that I got look exactly like the ones in the profile pages. And everything that was communicated in the description/ amenities turned out the way it is. No surprises at all, but just a delightful stay.

Cindy was also very flexible with a few hours extension request. I could only pick up my luggage past the checkout time. And she said it wasn't any problem and even suggested to use my room to shower first before going to the airport, since the next booking for the room is the day after. That was nice of her and appreciated it very much.

She also has this handy welcome kit/ survival guide which was very useful. It's updated regularly and guests can refer to that to create an itinerary.

I highly recommend staying at this place! A five out five star rating."
128496,"We had the best time at Cindy's and Nick's place. The rooms are big and comfortable enough and you really live between the locals. Sure you check into a Hotel but staying here will give you a more true Chinese experience. Cindy and Nick also helped us to plan our trip further on into China and organised a bbq with very good chicken skewers! If we go to Beijing again, we will stay here again."
128496,"Initial interactions with the owner were excellent.  She provided detailed information on the area as well as maps with local restaurants, shops, and other establishments.  She also provided basic information on local customs and cautions on things to avoid.
Getting to the apartment area was somewhat challenging.  Even with a local guide, it was tough to maneuver to the main alley entrance.  After several phone calls were were able to find it.  The owners were very defensive about allowing a guide in and asked him to remain at the main alley entrance and would not let him see our accommodations, which made us feel somewhat uncomfortable.  You would only be able to find the right alley doorway (with a code) and subsequent final doorway (after passing through a hallway of small one room local residences) with the owner guiding you.
The owner (and husband) tended to be somewhat curt, but I think that is just their personality.  The rooms were as described.  Everything was clean and prepared.  The rooms were clean and outfitted even the small things (shower shoes, q-tips, toothpaste, etc.  The rooms were quiet and all requests were answered promptly (communicated with (Hidden by Airbnb) ).
The courtyard had plenty of sitting space, but were were honestly on the go for the most part. There was a central community kitchen with some supplies (some food, refrigerator, utensils).
Aside from the difficulty with initial access, it was a nice place to stay"
128496,"Me and my husband loved Beijing. Cindy's Garden made the experience even better. All the good reviews are true. It is safe, comfy, authentic and beautifull place to stay. Cindy and Nick are great hosts, they helped us wherever they could and gave us good tips. We also enjoyed the breakfast room, with toast and coffee. Thanks for taking good care of us!"
128496,It was one of the best experience I had living in a traditional courtyard house in beijing. Cindy and Nick were awesome hosts which provided more than sufficient information and knowledge about beijing and getting around beijing. Cindy was very kind to assist me in my booking of train tickets to xian and also helping to buy items on (Website hidden by Airbnb) Room was very unique. Area was quiet at night and dark. we would see the bright moon and the stars in the clear skies. You could also climb up the rooftop terrace and look at the surrounding. Location was great. Sandwiched between metro line. Line 2 and line 5 thus very easy to get to the places of interest. Easy to take a bus to the sunlitun area. No lack of eateries around the area. Just before the alley were many fruit stalls and around the corner there is the famous dadong restaurant.

128496,"L'appartement était tout à fait conforme au descriptif.
Très bon accueil; Cindy et Nicos nous ont beaucoup aidé dans nos démarches, nos déplacements.
Toujours de la gentillesse pour répondre à nos questions.
Deux vélos disponibles et cela a été très utile pour nous promener.
Point de chute central, à quelques minutes du métro.
Seul petit bémol, le confort, en particulier pour les toilettes et la douche, n'est pas celui d'un très bon h?tel mais cela est normal dans un hutong pékinois et on ne peut pas tout avoir.
ADRESSE  A CONSEILLER."
128496,"Cindy and Nick were great hosts. They helped us a lot to organise our trip and where very welcoming. I felt at home at there place.

The room was nice and clean, the place itself is an hidden garden in the center of beijing.

They anticipated our needs and everything was made to make our stay in beijing unforgettable ( map of the city, washing machine, cooking lessons, etc.)

I would go back there anytime.

HIGHLY recommanded  !"
128496,"Cindy and Nick are such wonderful hosts. Great coffee and ample snacks provided! The tour suggestions they made were very sensible and suitable for us who were first timers in Beijing. We went to a less populated part of the Great Wall, the view was amazing! The location was superb and near to subways, though Beijing is too big to explore on foot. "
128496,"We are very happy to have chosen Cindy's place as a base to visit Beijing, for a lot of reasons:

1 - Location : the place is located in a hutong, which is an attraction by itself for westerners. It is also between 2 subways, so a lot of venues are easily reachable by subway, which was our main way of moving. So getting where we wanted was not too long considering the size of the city.

There is also a big supermarket nearby, some convenience and fruits store a minute away, and a couple of really good restaurants.

2 - Cindy and Nick made us feel as home. Every morning started with a simple but effective breakfast with the other guests. A good way to start the day.

3 - The room was clean and big enough for us to be confortable, AC was working perfectly and in this heat and humidity (40 degres) it was soo nice to have it. We slept like babies at night, absolutely no outside noise.

4 - Organization : Cindy is well organized and we had all the necessary information to get to her place. This was especially important the first time, as taxi drivers don't speak english and the place could be hard to find the first time around, especially after dark. 

She also has a list of restaurants and attractions and how to get there that could be very helpful.

All in all, we strongly recommand Cindy and Nick as hosts for a stay in Beijing.

Thanks again Cindy and Nick and have a great summer !"
128496,"I had an amazing stay with Cindy and Nik. Was trying to pack a lot into a 24 hour layover after a couple weeks in Yunnan, and they made sure I had everything I needed to feel comfortable, explore the city, and get a sense of the place. Their space is amazing -- roof decks, garden, cozy kitchen, comfy bed, etc. -- and they were the most welcoming, funny, sweet hosts you could ever hope for. Will definitely stay here whenever I'm in Beijing (and definitely hoping to make that a more frequent occurrence!)"
128496,"Cindy & Nic were great hosts. We really enjoyed our stay in their hutong. 5-10 min walk to subway lines, Cindy's map & guide to the local area & Beijing was very helpful. 
Emails responded to very quickly. They organised a trip to The Great Wall for us. It was a memorable experience. 
Would recommend staying here. 
Thank you, Cindy & Nic!"
128496,"I stayed here for 3 days with my (Website hidden by Airbnb) a really nice place!
Both the hosts are nice and super helpful (with directions or general info about sights). The rooms are clean and the location is pretty central.
I'd definitely recommend staying here :)"
128496,"Cindy's place is a temple heaven by itself, a garden, a roof top and a hutong atmosphere. I had a really pleasant stay during the 14 days and had the occasion to learn about Chinese culture and even Chinese language.

The presence of guests from all over the world made it also like a babel island among the vastness of Beijing.

Cindy and Nick were also always willing to solve out out all the problems I had to face during my stay.

I can only warmly recommend this place.

Sincerly yours,
Damien MARX"
128496,"Cindy and Nick were the perfect hosts, very welcoming and full of useful tips and information.  Cindy even went to the trouble of providing gluten free breakfast  cereal for my partner and I enjoyed the cold beer after  a full day sightseeing. Cindy arranged good driver/car for trip to the Wall and the Hutong accommodation was every bit as charming  as the photos depicted. Would highly recommend to future travellers."
128496,"Cindy and Nick were really friendly hosts and helped us to feel at home! Their accommodation is well located,  not far from 2 subway stations, and not too far from the center. 
They gave us useful tips (especially the Hotpot restaurant!) and arranged a taxi to go to the Great Wall. 
Thank you again (and for the Nutella/beer!) even if you don't like Pandas as much as we do ;) "
128496,"This is the perfect place to stay in Beijing, in a beautiful Hutong (traditional house).
Everything is near: the subway is just 5 min by walk, the place is quiet and very nice with great balconnet.
The hosts Cindy and Nik are very helpful and prevenant. They will help you from your arrival to your departure.

I warmly recommend you this place and its hosts."
128496,"My husband and I spent 4 nights at Cindy's. We loved it! Our favorites would be the comfy bed, the always-open breakfast room, the relaxing courtyard & upper deck, being in a traditional Beijing home tucked in a tree-lined alley, and of course, the warmest (& fun!) hospitality shown by Cindy and Nick! Our stay will always be remembered. :)"
128496,"Cindy and Nick were wonderful hosts! They really made me feel at home, and relaxed. I enjoyed their company, I left feeling like I'd made friends!
The accommodation is accurate to the pictures, pleasant, clean, and comfortable. It is located in a perfectly central area, right between two different metro lines, and a bus as well, taking you straight to Sanlitun in a mere 4 stops. 
The kitchen area was well stocked with all the basic necessities, coffee, tea, biscuits, even beer!
I would definitely recommend this place! I will return!"

128496,"Cindy and her husband Nik were great hosts. I can warmly recommend this accomodation. The rooms were cosy, felt original and clean. It′s the perfect place to relax after a day full of sightseeing, and it′s perfect for sightseeing because of the great location (a short walk from the subway). You can′t wish for more."
128496,"We had a wonderful short stay at Cindy and Nick's place.
The highlight was their fully equipped communal kitchen / social hub.
"
128496,"I was travelling to Beijing alone and wanted to stay somewhere authentic, central and with friendly, fun and interesting people around. Cindy and Nik's place fit the bill perfectly! 

Even before arriving in Beijing, Cindy emailed me her incredible survival guide - transportation, food, sights and general information about how to survive, and enjoy Beijing were all included; and greatly appreciated!  

Cindy sent pictures showing where her home was along with instructions in Chinese, which was really great for using cabs.

I arrived very early and had let Cindy know beforehand. As no one had been staying in my room the previous night, I was able to 'check-in'. Nik had left a note on my door (so I knew which it was) and left a note on the kitchen door so I could help myself to tea / snacks / beer etc. Just what I needed after my long flight.

I can't leave a review without mentioning the bed!!! THE MOST COMFORTABLE BED IN CHINA I SHOULD THINK! 

Both Cindy and Nik will make you feel like they're friends you've known for a lifetime yet they're not intrusive - you're perfectly free to come and go as suits you best.

The only place to stay in Beijing!"
128496,"Cindy and Nick are welcoming, friendly, helpful and you will feel like you are home away from home! The only place to stay in Beijing!

Please also see my previous review. "
128496,"Cindy and Nick are a very welcoming and entertaining couple: for me it felt like a home away from home, among friends.  If I return to Beijing I would definitely make this my first choice.  Amazing peace and quiet amid the bustle and noise of the city and close to subways and main thoroughfares."
128496,"We cannot say enough wonderful things about our stay with Cindy and Nick. Truly, we found a home away from home.

The apt is central to everything you could possibly want to do in Beijing and has every amenity including a cold beer awaiting your arrival. We walked to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City and everywhere we ate which were all delicious. The subway is very close and a single bus, steps away takes you straight to the train station. Also, the atmosphere is welcoming and provides opportunity to meet other guests, if you so choose.

Cindy and Nick are extremely helpful and reply promptly to every question, providing advice on places to eat and visit as well as directions and travel tips around the city. They are simply fabulous.

Should we ever return to Beijing, we will return home to Dongsi 8."
128496,"Great location and room. The directions were accurate and easy to follow. Nice rooftop patio, my fav. place to be in the morning especially with the amazing weather that flew in. "
128496,"If you wish to experience an authentic side of life in China, you will want to stay with Cindy and Nick in their courtyard house in a hutong in central Beijing. 

While living in one of their rooms is a big step up in comfort and facilities than most of their neighbors, you will be. in the middle of one of the oldest and least modernized neighborhoods in the city.

Nick and Cindy are the best AirBnB hosts I have ever experienced in China or the U.S.  They made sure from the moment I booked that I was supplied with a survival guide to Beijing and directions, photos and their address in Chinese characters, which was critical since their home is not easy to find, especially for tourists and taxi drivers used to locating hotels.

They also made sure I had all I needed in my room - heaters, hot showers, Internet and plenty of space - to make my nights comfortable.  For those of us culturally bound to western style breakfast, coffee, cereal and milk,toast and jam was available, as was cold beer and ouzo after a long hectic day in Beijing. Cindy also lent me a phone to make sure I could connect with local residents without using my smartphone.

Nick pointed out where the best places to find great dumplings or a local microbrew down the alley

People watching along the Dongsi 8th Alley was a favorite pass time for me. And it was always such a shock to emerge from Cindy and Nick's home and journey out to the large busy streets outside the hutong and realize just how quiet life is inside the Dongsi 8th Alley and Cindy and Nick's home.

The best part of my stay with Cindy and Nick was talking and laughing with this highly critical and enterprising couple. As I told them when I left, I came to Beijing to develop a documentary on China's environment but after staying with Cindy and Nick for five days, I really want to create a reality show starring the two of them operating one of the few courtyard homes owned by a family since before 1949. This in itself is an amazing story, but Cindy and Nick's take on Life in Modern China is the appeal.

Book time here and you will never think of China quite the same again."
128496,We were sorry we had only two nights with Cindy. The hospitality went above and beyond anything we had expected and the experience of staying in a hutong was enchanting. Highly recommended. 
128496,"If you want to get a feel of living in a hutong then this is the place to stay. Hutongs are unique to Beijing in China and are large part of what makes Beijing special. Unless you are wedded to staying in a western style hotel, then stay here. The two hosts really make stay the nice and are very informative. great location as well.  "
128496,"The place is in traditional Chinese style that is super nice and adorable! Location is good and quite convenient to find. Cindy is very friendly and provides many things that may need in travelling even some travel plan which is very considerating! If I can travel next time, definitely I would stay again!"
128496,"Cindy is possibly the best airbnb host out there. The ""Welcome Guide"" she provided was invaluable. First it saved us 500RMB by telling us how much a taxi should cost from the airport, which kept us from accepting an offer from somebody trying to take advantage of us (and to not take it personally when the first taxi driver wouldn't pick us up). Furthermore the directions provided for how to get to her place are perfect. The taxi drivers dropped us off at exactly the right alley, which is no small feat for Beijing! Her Welcome Guide also has directions for how to get to every major tourist attraction using public transportation, which made us feel comfortable enough to try out getting around without a tour guide.

Our room was clean and larger than I expected for Beijing with plenty of room for our luggage, plus enough heating and bedding to keep us warm.

Finally, I can't end this review without mentioning Cindy's generosity - from arranging a driver for our trip to the Great Wall, tickets to shows and the package of delicious sweet cookies she gave to us when we left knowing how much we loved them - she went above and beyond to be helpful. I can't recommend Cindy strongly enough. Stop reading this and go book a room right now."
128496,Cindy and Nikos were so fun to hang out with and their place is in an awesome location. The place is such a good way to experience Beijing! 
128496,"We had a great stay at Cindy's. Both she and Nick are friendly and warm with great senses of humour.  Cindy helped us out registering at the police station for our 72 hour visa and organised a car to take us to the Great Wall. The location is superb, close to the main sites and 5 mins walk to the subway. The room was lovely, comfy bed and warm (it was December and -3 degrees outside! We loved the breakfast room which was well thought out with plenty to eat and drink. Would definitely reccomend to friends and hope to visit again."
128496,"Our stay with Cindy and Nick was fantastic! They were both very kind, friendly, warm, helpful and really fun to chat with! The place was at the heart of Beijing. Very near to the subway. Room is big and spacious. Very well heated in the cold winter! Warm showers as well! Also, a really nice pub just down the street. Amazing experience. Possibly the best airbnb experience I had by far! So if u are looking for a place in Beijing, look no further!! "
128496,"Cindy and Nick were excellent hosts. They were very helpful, informative, and genuine. It was great to stay in a hutong and experience a much more authentic experience. The location is close to two train lines which made it convenient to see various sites. Would definitely highly recommend staying with Cindy! 

A side note for travelers (this is separate from my review of this listing). We tried taking bus 877 to the Great Wall of China. We arrived at the location at 11:05am and saw the sign that said that buss 877 runs from 6:00-12:00. There were about 20 others in line. We waited until 12:20pm and the bus never arrived. One by one, the others in line left. We have not idea what happened to the busses, and the government employees working the bus stop were not helpful. We ended up having Cindy arrange for a taxi driver for us. It's more expensive than the bus, but it ended up being worth it. The driver was friendly and trustworthy. We were able to go straight to Mu Yian Tu and experience the Wall at sunset. "
128496,"Everything was well prepared. Cindy has a package kit of information and everything she says about the houses are spot on. I think its a great place to stay, with the only comment that the winter is really cold.

At the rate of heating usage, they must have spent a fortune each night on the electrical bill and kept us very warm. Most 5 star hotels aren't that warm!"
128496,"Cindy and Nick were fantastic hosts. Our flight was delayed and we ended up arriving around 2am. They had arranged for a driver to pick us up from the airport, which we highly recommend, as most people do not speak English. Nick was there to greet us and show us around despite the late hour of our arrival. They were very helpful throughout our stay and gave us tips and directions. We stayed in December and our room was warm the entire time and we even turned off the extra heater at some points. We couldn't hear any neighbours in adjacent rooms, which was nice as we tended to sleep in. We highly recommend staying here if you are looking for an authentic Beijing hutong experience."
128496,"Cindy et Nick (nos h?tes) sont des êtres adorables. Cindy avait organisé le taxi entre l'aéroport et son logement comme cela nous n'avions aucunes questions à nous poser après ce long voyage. Un chauffeur nous attendait à la sortie de l'avion!
Arrivés dans sa maison au milieu des hutongs fut très dépaysant. Aprés la visite de la location ainsi que d'une très bonne explication des lieux à visiter et des moyens de transport, ils nous ont invité à les rejoindre avec leurs amis autours d'un BBQ. 
Chaque soir, ils nous ont conseillés de trés bon restaurant et nous debriefions notre journée tout en préparant la suivante autour d'un thé. 
Cindy a également organisé la réservation d'un chauffeur pour aller voir la grande muraille. Ce fut vraiment un agréable séjour.
La location était propre et l'emplacement est idéal pour être au c?ur de Pekin et accéder aux lieux touristiques facilement par le métro.
Cindy a également organisé un cours de cuisine pour nous apprendre a faire des dumplings (raviolis chinois). Moment riche en échange!"
128496,"Cindy went above and beyond to welcome me into her beautiful hutong apartments in Beijing, I loved everything about staying here and feel like I made good friends in the process. The location was beyond ideal for me, I could walk to super cool music venues and delicious food and explore incredible history all around me. I loved the rooftop terrace, the morning coffee, the cozy bed, the cool other guests - just everything. Highly recommended. "
128496,OK....fact -- staying with Cindy is a MUST on your bucket list! Walking the Great Wall of China cool but almost pales compared to Cindy and Nick's slick style of hospitality in an old world environment.
128496,Cindy and Nick made us feel right at home in this conveniently located apartment. The welcome guide and travel tips along the way were incredibly helpful and helped us make the most of our time in Beijing. They are great fun to be around -  we loved hanging out and especially appreciated the meal and plenty of beer as a birthday treat!
128496,"Absolutely LOVED staying with Cindy and Nick.  Such great communication beforehand, so helpful! Their intro pack was incredible and had loads of great tips.

It was so great getting a real flavour of Beijing staying in the hutongs.

Room and courtyard were just as described and location was ace!

So helpful and informative throughout, a must if you are planning a trip to Beijing."
128496,"Highly recommended.

Good location.
Comfy room and hot shower in lovely courtyard.
Friendly and helpful hosts."
128496,"????? ?????
???????~??????????~"
128496,Cindy and Nick were always ready to help and surely made us feel at home. They gave us a lot of very useful information. They were ready to go the extra mile to be sure we were fine.  The place and the area were as expected. We highly recommend their place.
128496,It was a great experience to stay with cindy and nick! Definitely best place to stay in beijing!
128496,"Real nice place with real nice people !

Nick and Cindy 've welcome us and told us some tips to survive in Beijing , and they 're always ready to help.

nice localisation , central in Beijing, clean room. The breakfast is perfect, with all that you need . 

If i come back to Beijing, i know where to go !"
128496,"Staying with Cindy and Nick in this perfectly located real place was very comfortable and gave us a much more genuine stay, as visitors rather than tourists. Their hospitality and accommodations are excellent. Our only regret was that our stay was so short!"
128496,"If you're looking for a genuine local interaction without having to stay in a hostel, look no further. Comfortable accommodations, incredibly flexible and caring hosts. Please treat them right, they deserve it.  

Cindy and Nick, thank you!!"
128496,"Cindy und Nick waren tolle Gastgeber - vor allem die Tipps in Bezug auf die Erreichbarkeit der wichtigsten Sehenswürdigkeiten und die Restaurantempfehlungen waren Gold wert! Auch die Lage der Unterkunft ist super, da man von dort aus problemlos per U-Bahn zu allen interessanten Punkten in Peking kommt. Auf jeden Fall weiterzuempfehlen :)"
128496,"Nous avons eu un excellent accueil. La chambre était grande, le lit confortable, douche et toilettes privatifs. 
Hutong authentique!"
128496,"Amazing place to stay. We had a wonderful time. Was a perfect end to our trans Siberian trip. A real huton to stay in but with all mod cons. In a great location. Cindy and Nick were great hosts, couldn't ask for more. "
128496,"We had a fantastic experience at Cindy and Nick's. The house location was excellent, close to the metro lines and easy to access. They were most helpful in helping us plan our days in Beijing. The room was neat, clean and very quiet at night. We will for sure stay here again when we return to Beijing!"
128496,"Our China trip featured two rounds in Beijing, first in a posh Western hotel with a group, then with Cindy and Nick in their hutong. We're so glad that we opted for Cindy and Nick over the hotel in round two! We got a much better feel for residential life in Beijing, but with the basic comforts to make a hot few days in Beijing manageable. We really enjoyed the shared kitchen and its supplies, as well as the courtyard garden and rooftop decks. "
128496,Extremely lovely place! A gem in the heart of the Dongsi neighbourhood. Cindy provided details and made me feel very welcome at her place. Highly recommended if you want an authentic experience in Beijing. 
128496,We had an awesome time with Cindy and Nick. They were very helpful and answered our million and one questions. They helped us organise a car for our Great Wall trip and we had a lovely evening making dumplings. The house was beautiful as well as the roof terrace. I would definitely stay with Cindy and Nick again the perfect place to stay in Beijing. 
128496,"Cindy and Nick were awesome hosts.  They provided breakfast and dumpling making lessons.  They let us use their washer.  They recommended iteneraries, booked taxis and arranged for off the beaten track trip to the wall.  The atmosphere at their home is a true Beijing experience.  My children and I felt welcomed and enjoyed playing cards on the roof top watching the full moon.  I would stay here again and recommend this place with 5 stars!"
128496,"Cindy and Nick were great hosts. Extremely friendly and very helpful! They provided recommendations for things to do in the area and even gave us a city map when we first arrived. The house is in a great area that feels very authentic, it's extremely comfortable and a friendly environment to spend a few days in. They have refreshments and snacks always available as well as filtered water. We had a great time and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to visit Beijing!"
128496,"Very well located accommodation. The pictures correspond perfectly to the place.

Cindy and  his companion are super nice and friendly and are willing to help for any information.
"
128496,"Cindy and Nick are fantastic! I was taking the Transmongolian into Beijing and they kindly offered to pick me up at the train station. Unfortunately my train was delayed for four hours! Nick stayed two hours to wait but understandably left. When I did finally arrive to Beijing, they gave me very clear instructions on how to get to their amazing home. It was such a relief to take a shower and sleep on a nice mattress after so many days on a hot train!

Later that night, they helped me locate my friends' hostel, even though it was very difficult to find. Thanks to Cindy and Nick's persistence, we found it and they got us out of a very terribly touristy part of town and into a more hospitable one that had a delicious restaurant. Without Cindy's help, we would never have had such a great meal on our first night in Beijing!

My friends were so taken in by Cindy and Nick's hospitality that they were ready to pack everything up and move out of their hostel and into Cindy and Nick's home that night! Even though the apartment was fully booked, Cindy very kindly offered to let them sleep on the roof. It was a joke that I'm glad no one took seriously because it was pouring rain. But on a clear night I probably would have slept on that amazing roof. It had great views and a nice breeze!

The apartment feels much larger than how the photos look. It was clean and nicely furnished with a mix of modern and traditional decor. Perfectly situated between two subway stations, all of Beijing is within reach. The courtyard and roof are what caught my attention with this listing. But Cindy and Nick are really why this was such a memorable experience. Their hospitality and warm personalities are the beating forces behind this Heart of Beijing."
128496,Cindy and Nick are great hosts. They both have a good sense of humour and are more than happy to help out whenever they can. Their place in Beijing is quite unique and has a very cool terrace layout perfect for a few quiet beers (on the house) in the afternoon/evening. The accommodation itself is quite basic but has everything you need. In actual fact I liked this place more than Beijing itself! 
128496,"Cindy has a fantastic place to offer! 
Very well located in the outer centre and hidden in the back alleys, you get a good insight of Beijing's off path's day to day! 

The rooms are big and offer all the essentials you need. The kitchen is full of local and European products (for those who think breakfast is sacred). 

Cindy and Nick are very welcoming and full of advise to maximise your trip and prepare for the city! 

We also had the opportunity to share a car with a wonderful family on a day trip to the great wall of China. A big thanks to both of them! "
128496,"Ok, let me start this review with all the bad things about this place..... wait there aren't any! The previous reviews are ""spot on"".  The kitchen is well-stocked, the room is clean and comfortable, and the neighborhood and home are exactly as described.  Cindi and her assistant are pretty cool!  Thats you Nick.  Both are very knowledgeable about Beijing and know how to make things happen for you.  I had a nice time chatting with both.  I would do it again."
128496,"Cindy und Nick waren einfach perfekte Gastgeber - beantworten alle Fragen und sorgen sich wirklich um ihre G?ste. Unser H?uschen war auch super, mit allem was man so braucht. Wir werden definitiv wieder kommen bei unserem n?chsten Peking-Besuch."
128496,"I really enjoyed my stay at Cindy's place. All the instructions that I got before arriving to Beijing were very helpful and spot on, the place is exactly as described, the room was very spacious, the kitchen had everything one can need for breakfast or a quick snack if you feel peckish at night after a long day walking around Beijing, everything was very clean. 
The location is excellent, very close to 2 different tube stations with easy access to pretty much everywhere in the city.

Nick was a great host and he was always around which was really good as he recommended some good places to visit and helped us organise the trip to the Great Wall which was amazing.
I would definitely recommend this place and I know for sure that the next time I'm in Beijing I would love to stay here again."
128496,"We had a great stay a Cindy and Nicks! The room was very comfortable and was in such an interesting location. Cindy and Nick were awesome and so helpful to us during our short stay. If you are going to Beijing, stay here!!"
128496,"Cindy and Nick are great hosts, providing good tips (restaurants, things to see). They even booked a driver for us to go to the Great Wall on a non-renovated section!
The hutong is typical, clean and well located for the metro (2 lines less than 10 min away). The area is a real Chinese neighborhood, you don't see many tourists. This is just like in the pictures! 
We highly recommend! "
128496,"Cindy and Nick were excellent hosts.  Cindy has a ""survival guide"" with information about Beijing and the neighborhood surrounding their hutong that was quite useful.  She also helped arrange a driver to go to the Great Wall at Huanghuacheng which was a lot of fun.

The flat is described accurately, and combined with their shared courtyard and series roof decks the area is quite spacious.  The location is reasonably convenient to lines 5 and 2, and with a bit more of a walk lines 4, 13, and the airport express.

Cindy and Nick were incredibly welcoming and a lot of fun to talk to.  I would love to stay here again."
128496,"Cindy & Nick 是对 开郎,乐观和平易近人的一对夫妇,隨时都很乐易的为我们提供任何所需的资讯,每天早上都可听到Cindy欢愉的笑声和一些分享,为旅程添一些色彩. 房间宽大和舒适,传统四合院的住宿,深入体验当地人的生活,值得推荐?"
128496,"My wife and I spent a week here.  It was exactly what we were looking for and as described.  It is centrally located within the 2nd ring road, and we had easy access to the city via subway, bus, or walking.  There are several local-flavored restaurants, supermarket, and even a craft beer place very close by.  Accommodations were clean and comfortable, with a private sit-on toilet, showers, air-conditioning.  There is a rooftop area to enjoy the views of the surrounding hutong/city in addition to the beautiful courtyard with overhanging gourd.  Felt very safe and quiet.  Cindy and Nick are fabulous hosts, always available and helpful, with great sense of humor.  No hesitations whatsoever in recommending to others."
128496,"Cindy and Nick were terrific hosts. From the 1st contact and arrangements to the last warm goodbye we were treated like family:  drawn maps, tutored in how to negotiate cabs, pointed to excellent restaurants, advised on what to see and what not and they even made us good breakfasts! The neighborhood is a unique experience of old Beijing and so are the rooms and whole atmosphere. If you're looking for something special other than skyscrapers this is the place."
128496,"Cindy and Nick are very welcoming hosts and helpful in planning our days in Beijing.
Our room was super clean, plenty of hot water, comfy bed and a quiet oasis at the end of the day.  We wouldn't hesitate to stay with them again.  Thanks for sharing your home with us."
128496,"Staying with Cindy and Nick was awesome! Before we arrived, Cindy sent an 8-attachment email with a lot of information about China and Beijing. Nick met us at the train station and we took the bus back to their place. It was right in the middle of one of the old Beijing neighborhoods.  The room was clean and comfortable and having breakfast in the mornings or drinks in the evenings with Nick and Cindy was the highlight of the stay.  We would stay there again anytime!"
128496,"Terrific experience at Cindy and Nick's where they manage to create a lovely communal atmosphere among the travelers which you can dip in and out of as you prefer. The room was really nice and very well located for all of the city's main attractions. Just to reemphasise, I've used Airbnb all over the world and the experience has been very good but rarely have I seen such a wonderful environment as that created here by the hosts. Thoroughly recommended!"
128496,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time staying at Cindy and Nick's place. They were extremely kind, accommodating, genuine, and fun hosts. It's always nice to learn more about the city you are visiting by staying with people who know the place! The room was as described, the survival kit and instructional guide sent by Cindy was extremely helpful in getting around and helping us know what to expect before we arrived in Beijing. Would recommend their courtyard home to friends and family. Thanks Cindy and Nick!!"
128496,"I had a wonderful time staying at Cindy and Nick's place. Right after the request was accepted Cindy sent a lot of helpful material that I could use to plan my stay there. From transportation options to local restaurants to eat at, the information was very helpful. I opted for a driver to pick me up at the airport since it was dark when I was arriving and I have never been to Beijing before. Cindy arranged the whole the thing and the driver was waiting at arrivals with my name on the sign. My room was amazing! It was very spacious and spotless. The bed was very comfortable and great hot water in the bathroom. There is the kitchen room that is open 24 hours that had different kinds of food and drinks available to guests. The location is very convenient to two subway lines and there are always taxis driving around. Cindy and Nick are great people. I had the chance to hang out with them one night and it was a blast! While I was only there two nights and never met them before I felt like I was their friend for a long time. I highly recommend staying here. I can't wait to come back again! "
128496,"Staying here was fantastic! Cindy and Nick were amazing hosts; they provided excellent instructions and were always happy to answer questions and provide tips on being street smart around Beijing.  Furthermore they were incredibly welcoming, friendly and always up for a chat.
The accommodation itself was also great. Easy access to the subway and in a beautiful, traditional area of town. I would highly recommend staying here to anyone visiting Beijing."
128496,"To stay with Cindy and Nick is really awesome. Excellent location to discover Beijing and to get an idea about and the spirit of Chinese day to day life. The accommodation was exactly as described. Nick and Cindy are very friendly and helpful, perfect command of English is available which is really an advantage in China. They demonstrate that a Greek Chinese relationship could work quite well (Europe to note). 
Thank you very much for this perfect stay and your hospitality, would really love to come again."
128496,"We had a great time with Nic and Cindy - amazing couple.  They made arrangements for us to be met from the airport and Nic was waiting for us at the top of the alley. We felt very welcome.  Nic and Cindy are very considerate hosts - they provided us with masks because the pollution was high.  They gave us good guidance on getting around Beijing and seeing all the sights at a tiny fraction of the cost that tour operators charge!  Its a very relaxed household and you do experience the real Huton living.  Absolutely fascinating.  The flat was private, secure, clean and very homely.  When we needed a taxi, they recommended Tom who was an absolute delight.  We are indebted to Cindy, Nic and Tom as they made our visit to Beijing very relaxed and enjoyable.  Thank you!"
128496,"Cindy and Nick are amazing. While we unfortunately did not get to meet Cindy since she was travelling, we heard all about her fame from her equally amazing and intelligent husband (who will deny any compliments and probably make a joke or two).  Best hosts I've encountered who provide an extremely comfortable living space in perhaps an occasionally hostile environment in Beijing (no offense Beijing you are beautiful). Also,  they set you up with the best instructions ever.  Don't expect to ever feel lost in Beijing with their guidance."
128496,"Staying here was a wonderful experience! The room was clean, spacious, and quiet (despite being in the heart of Beijing!).  It was in a great location (less than 10 min walk from the nearest metro) and Nick was a great host. It was lovely to have a common room where we could have breakfast or a beer. "
128496,"good location and close to public transportation, host was really nice and friendly. "
128496,"Cindy and Nic were the most gracious and attentive hosts. Our first trip to Beijing ran very smoothly, and it is to them we owe our thanks to!  The welcome kit and assistance in arranging drivers for the airport was a huge help.  Cindy and Nic also provided us with great recommendations to eat. We miss the dumplings around the corner!

The location was situated in a very convenient and (happening!) area with 2 metro stations nearby.  The hutong itself was quite charming and clean.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to Beijing. Cindy and Nic made great company as well! And the free cookies and coffee in the morning aren't such a bad deal :)"
128496,We stayed 5 days with Cindy and enjoyed our big room and the huge shower. Living in a Central Hutong is a special experience and gives you the possibility to explore the city by bus and sub. Cindy organized the transfer and some trips and had always some hints for special places. Thanks for that
128496,"Great hosts and a great time! Cindy and Nick made themselves available at all times of the day and gave us great tips. The breakfast room was stocked with basic necessities and the host even made dumplings and pancakes for everyone. A cold beer at the end of the day was also a bonus!
This is the best way to stay in Beijing-thank you Cindy and Nick for a memorable stay!
"
128496,"What a perfect home away from home! Cindy and Nick are so welcoming and quick-witted, a ton if fun to spend time with before or after your day of exploring Beijing.  They have several people staying in their complex at once, so there are some great opportunities to bond with your fellow travelers, too.  The room was lovely, and the place is in a perfect location!  Highly recommended, and I hope I can return one day!"
128496,It was an absolute joy staying with Cindy & Nick in Dongsi 8th Alley 
128496,"Amazing! Cindy and Nick are incredible hosts and this neighborhood was perfect for our stay in Beijing! And the house itself was simply magical. I highly recommend this spot. Thank you, Cindy and Nick!"
128496,"As always Cindy and Nick were super welcoming hosts. They helped out with all the travel arrangements and made sure everything was super smooth.

Cindy is a little rusty with her Bollywood dance moves but I'm sure with practice she can be as good as me :-)"
128496,"Cindy was an incredible host. Her survival guide was very useful, it included detailed instructions and pictures for getting from the airport to her home. 
The written descriptions that Cindy provided of the area of her home invasion and her home were very complete and accurate. In addition, she emailed us a few days before my wife and daughter begun their trip to China. Cindy double-checked whether Flora and Grace needed extra help getting from the airport to her home. 
My wife and daughter enjoy every bit of their stay with Cindy and her husband. Cindy's advice and guidance made their visit to Beijing wonderful. 
My wife and daughter highly recommend staying with Cindy. They feel as if they now have a friend in Beijing. 
Cindy's and her Airbnb is a gem. Flora and Grace give her all four thumbs up. 

Thanks Cindy for taking care of my wife and daughter!"
128496,"This is an amazing place. Even better than I expected. The location is fantastic and Cindy is a very nice host. Unfortunately I had a lot unexpected work in 798 art district and couldn't enjoy this place as I originally planned. So, we have to come back again...;-)"
128496,"我说她很棒!不不不
那样的评价很不够
我要说我是在北京有房子的人,就在三元桥凤凰城
我要说我是有亲戚他们住在北京大屯
但是这里,让我和我七岁的儿子如此喜欢,觉得是家的感觉真的好!
有时候觉得评价的标准太呆板了,这里如果许可,可以多几颗星星吗?如果可以我想到木梯到房顶看到的星星都采下来放上去!谢谢Cindy!替我问候您的朋友?妈妈!希望早日再见!"
128496,"Our intense short stay in Beijing was great! The hosts were more than welcoming and helped us out with our travel plan. Thanks to the hosts we managed to see the very best of Beijing in just two days. The room was correctly described, and situated right in the center of the Beijing hutongs."
128496,"Cindy and Nick was a very welcome host, she provided a lot of indications before our arrival. The place is as described in a hutong, the alley is not spotless but you don't feel unsafe at any moment. We were a party of 5 staying in two rooms. Cindy was very helpful arranging a driver for us to the wild part of the great wall, really worth it, on the way back we stopped at the summer palace. Cindy's place is very well located, just one stop away from the airport train, the subway is very convenient to move around all the city.  We loved the fun atmosphere that Cindy and Nick provided, we laughed a lot and loved to chill at the terrace at night after all the walking.  Cindy provided a Cindy Survival Kit with a lot of tips, but the restaurants list around the place was very useful, don't miss the Muslim, we went there several days and the roasted duck nearby that appears on the list, go early it gets packed! Don't miss the SlowBoat Brewery in the same alley! We didn't eat there but beer was nice and all the burgers look fantastic!"
128496,"This was the best Airbnb ever! We have stayed in over 20 places around the world and I have never felt so at home, so welcome, Cindy and Nick were the greatest hosts, they spent so much time helping us out and hanging out with us and our time in Beijing was 100x better as a result of their help. Cindy helped us with really great airport transfers, was happy to receive some deliveries for us (we forwarded luggage from Shanghai to Beijing to avoid having to take it with us in the meantime), she made fresh breakfast dumplings for me every day and NIck made his fantastic coffee, helped watch my kids in the playground and even came on a mission with me to pick up some stray luggage. 
The apartment was very spacious and comfortable, impeccably decorated and the communal kitchen was full of goodies (even beer) which we could help ourselves to free of charge. The communal courtyard and deck were truly great, we met some wonderful other guests and we just loved the street, a truly authentic hutong experience."
128496,"Amazing, there are no other words to describe our stay. The location of the traditional hutong of Cindy and Nick was perfect, we experienced the daily life of Beiijng people yet very close to the modern life style and shops. Even if we didn't spend a lot of time inside our apartment, because we wanted to see and experience as much as we could from Beijing, everything was perfect inside the hutong. The breakfast room was provided with every kind of food and snacks and the neighbourhoods were so peaceful and quiet. I think this is another reason for us to come back again next time to enjoy more the peaceful and relaxing life!"
128496,"My sister's family stayed here last month and highly recommended it to me and she is certainly right.  Cindy and Nick are wonderful hosts!  They are genuinely helpful and accommodating. If you want an authentic hutong experience with excellent English communications,  book this place.  It is so much more interesting than staying at a hotel. "
128496,The house is very nice and located in a traditional neighborhood. Cindy is always there to help or have a chat about China. There is free breakfast and a nicely decorated yard.
128496,"The best Airbnb I’ve been to yet! The place is fantastic, an oasis in a sometimes chaotic city. Cindy and Nick are awesome, showed us many great places and told many great stories. Can’t recommend the place highly enough!"
128496,"We had an absolute wonderful time in this gorgeous home. A peaceful place in never sleeping Beijing. It's so nice to stay inside the hutongs and see the daily life there. Cindy and Nick are both very nice people, we had nice chats and laughs with them. The arranged a minivan to the great wall with what very good. The breakfast is a good way to start the day, the Donkey burger was quit something ;-) The room is spacious an clean. And around the place there a many nice spots to chase some cars. We really recommend this place! "
128496,"非常nice的房东,很为房客着想!孩子特别喜欢露台,房间里的DVD也很对胃口!如果还来北京还会来住!"
128496,"Cindy and Nick were amazing hosts. Their local knowledge proved to be an enormous help, while their sense of human was an additional bonus. 
I felt like I was visiting friends. The rooms are clean and comfortable, air conditioning is working -what more do you need?"
128496,"Awesome ""close to Hutong"" location. Hosts always accessible and available. Extremely communicative and helpful, which is an absolute necessity in China.  Cindy and Nick are super who are travellers themselves, know what it takes."
128496,We had a wonderful stay.  Cindy will be your spunky and straight-shooting guide to Beijing!  The accommodations are great and you can't get more real than the Hutong environment!  Cindy's guide is indispensable also.  This is the best way to know the real Beijing while staying in a quiet and secluded portion of an old Hutong.
128496,"Really love this place. Autanthic hutong with beautiful garden and nice owners.
"
128496,"Cindy and Nick's place was a very nice, serene spot to stay during our Beijing holiday! Both hosts were flexible, full of suggestions, and funny. The house was very clean and the bed had a nice memory foam top layer (we had gotten used to hard chinese mattresses, this was a welcome luxury!). It is situated in a quiet hutong, where you are outside of the Chinese hustle and bustle. A green courtyard with gourds and flowers welcome you every morning when you open the curtains :). Cindy and Nick provided us with all different sorts of Chinese breakfasts, do try them if you are up for savory treats in the morning! They also taught us how to make dumplings along with the other guests. Cindy and Nick even let us stay longer, since our flight was later in the evening! In short, a great place to stay in Beijing where you can talk in English with great hosts while you can get an authentic hutong experience!"
128496,"Cindy and Nick are warm and welcoming hosts. They go the extra mile for their guests, arranging transportation and  tours, providing maps and directions and even special treats...like Donkey Burgers! The room we stayed in was spacious and clean and included all the necessary amenities.  Their house is in a nice, safe neighborhood within walking distance of restaurants, shopping, subway and bus lines. I highly recommend this Airbnb property to anyone looking for an authentic. Beijing experience. "
128496,Great place and great hosts. Would stay again.
128496,"This is a real siheyuan in a real hutong. Cindy goes out of her way to emphasize this in her listing, but it bears repeating, as those who seek more commercialized environs may be disappointed. However, if living like a local is what you're after, you'll be glad you stayed here.

Communication with Cindy and Nick before and throughout the stay was great. During the booking process I got all the information I needed, and got it quickly. During my two-week stay I found them to be the best kind of hosts: always accessible and helpful, but never obtrusive. And both are possessed of an active sense of humor. If you're the type who likes to chat over morning coffee, there will be plenty of time to partake in fun and engaging conversations. If you're more of a loner, you won't be pestered or pressured into anything. In either scenario, your privacy will be respected, as they won't enter your room unless they are invited or there is an emergency need. Of course that means the cleaning is up to you.

The neighborhood, near the center of the city, is crowded and lively, convenient to restaurants, markets and public transit. Despite that, the courtyard is very quiet at night. It's also, like the rest of Beijing, safe.

Don't hesitate to put some money on the transit cards that Cindy loans you for your stay so you can use the subway or buses. The subway is cheap, clean, safe, and easy to navigate. Having them available for guests was a nice touch.

I had a great stay. My traveling companion, a native of Beijing's Xidan district and no stranger to siheyuan life, did too. We got a spacious room in a traditional setting for a reasonable price. The hosts are nice, the location is convenient and the commode isn't in the shower, something repeat visitors to Beijing's hutongs will appreciate. Can't ask for much more than that.

"
128496,"Der etwas versteckt gelegene Hof ist ein guter Ausgangspunkt, um Peking zu entdecken und im Sommer ist es bestimmt sehr gemütlich, dort auf der Dachterasse mit einem Bier den Tag ausklingen zu lassen. Wir haben uns dort sehr wohl gefühlt. Die beiden Gastgeber tun alles, um es den G?sten so angenehm wie m?glich zu machen, wozu der gut gefüllte Kühlschrank im Frühstücksraum beitr?gt.  Die Zimmer sind sauber und ausreichend gro?. Die U-Bahn ist nur einen kurzen Spaziergang entfernt. In der Umgebung gibt es au?erdem zahlreiche gute Restaurants und Einkaufsm?glichkeiten. Wir würden wieder dort übernachten.  "
128496,Had a great time at Cindy and Nick's place! Convenient and comfy. Cindy and Nick were excellent hosts!
128496,"We have stayed in the hutong before so we were already familiar with the area, and Cindy's place was easier to find than others.  Very convenient from the subway and easy gate access.  Check-in and service from Nick was excellent.  Very comfortable bed!"
128496,"房东很热情,周到?舒心之旅?"
128496,"Cindy and Nick are excellent hosts! They are quickwitted, thoughtful conversationalists who love to laugh and enjoy a good time. We travelled with our three kids ages 16, 14 and 11 and they were patient, friendly and helpful with all of them. Cindy even hooked up our 16-year-old son with some Serbian skateboarding friends who helped him meet some local Chinese skateboarders. It's been the greatest thing as our son has been consistently online with his new friends every day since we've been home. He has developed a terrific friendship as a result of Cindy and Nick's kindness.

As international travelers who have also lived abroad we enjoyed the international community of friends in Cindy's home. We visited with Anders and Rasmus from Denmark, Alberto from Spain and two other Americans. If you are the type of person who wants to hole up in your room and not talk to anyone else, this is definitely not the place for you. The interactions with other guests was probably the most enjoyable part of our visit. We enjoyed a pizza 3 foot in diameter with everyone the night before we left and it was the greatest way to end our vacation!

If you pay careful attention to Cindy's description, you'll have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It's a house in hustings. It is in a fascinating neighborhood, but it is by no means a hotel. You're staying in someone's home. You have your own room with private bathroom. The patio area serves as a common area and there is a kitchen area with a fridge and sink and dishes and utensils that everyone has access to. Again, if you read and believe Cindy's description you'll know exactly what to expect. We had a great time. It was our favorite place of all the places we stayed during a three week trip and we highly recommend it!"
128496,"What can we say? Cindy and Nick are the best hosts anyone can ask for. If the exciting city of Beijing wasn't right outside their beautiful sanctuary, we would have been content to spend the whole week in the garden. The accommodations are exactly as described.  Simple, clean, and homey. If you want to experience beijing life as a local this is the way. Cindy provides all the information you need to explore the city on your own, avoiding all the infamous tourist traps. We can really say we feel we saw the best Beijing had to offer, much due to Cindy and Nick's spot on advice. If it seems like I'm laying it on a little thick, you just have to book a room and see for yourself. "
128496,"Cindy and Nick are great hosts. They helped us with everything - lo a transportation card, touristic sports and many other info. The place is so unique. They run this little Beijing 'si-he-yuan' with love and passion. They welcomed us with nice beer in the midst of a burning summer after long walk. Thanks a lot our dearest hosts. With love. "
128496,"房子很好,和圖片及介紹中差不多,很溫馨,地理位置也不錯? 房主很熱情,也很熱心幫忙,我因為剛到北京,道路不熟,房主主動帶我去找,讓我很感動 ........."
128496,"Cindy and Nick were great hosts. Cindy was easily contactable and friendly, helping us with all our needs."
128496,"If you are looking for unique and unforgettable experience of Beijing, look no further.  Cindy's traditional courtyard located on a quiet hutong is a true oasis in the heart of this mega city.  Beijing could be overwhelming, but this house, this neighborhood, and the kindness of Cindy and Nick welcomed us every day after our long excursions."
128496,"Could not have higher praise for Cindy and Nick’s place! They are incredibly kind and hospitable people and made sure I was completely at home for my week in Beijing. The room was spacious, clean, had everything I needed and the courtyard is located in a really charming neighbourhood. Fantastic place! Would recommend to everyone."
128496,"I can’t even decide where to begin. To have not even a home away from home,  but also an advocate for your happiness, like Cindy is beyond measure. I was able to be a dumb tourist as well as feel like a local. In two days in Beijing. I think this says it all!"
128496,Great place in a wonderful setting in a hutong neighborhood. Cindy & Nick are attentive to your needs and offer good suggestions. Highly recommended.
128496,"We had a great stay with Cindy and Nick! They were very welcomming and helped us get wherever we wanted to go. They were always in for a chat or a helping hand. The room was big and clean, with a private bathroom and hot shower. We loved the Hutong neighbourhood! A great place if you’re looking for some peace in a busy city"
128496,"We loved our stay at Cindy’s place. Her and Nick are fun and generous hosts! They gave us a lot of advice, took us to dinner and drinks, etc. One of our best AirBnB experiences!
And the location is very convenient to discover Beijing.
I would definitely recommend!"
128496,"From the moment you book til you leave Beijing plane, Cindy and Nick make sure you have a pleasant trip. Totally recommended!"
128496,Excellent stay at Cindy`s place. Also big thanks to Nick;!
128496,Cindy's place was located in a great neighbourhood and it was convenient to get to nearby sights. It is close to supermarkets and shops and at the same time enclosed in a traditional courtyard. Cindy and Nick were very helpful and gave us a lot of local tips and even arranged tickets and a taxi service to a quiet part of the Great Wall. We would stay there again.
128496,Cindy and Nick are amazing! They are really friendly! All the time help me with my plans. Always I felt like in home. The experience was awesome. Thank so much! I looking for see you again.
128496,This is the perfect place if you want to see Beijing from the hutongs. We loved staying here and felt very much at home. Cindy and Nick are super hosts! We would like to come back again next time we are going to Beijing 
161902,"The apartment is neat and clean and has everything you need to be self sustainable in Beijing. Its also in central location in Beijing, only a five minute walk to a popular  subway line. Robert is very helpful and went out of his way to answer any questions i had. The apartment is basic, but i didn't go to Beijing to stay in an apartment all day. "
161902,Robert was a great host.  The apartment was easy to find and was in great condition.  Robert was able to meet us earlier than we had originally planned without any problem.  It was a nice stay in Beijing.
161902,"I almost don't want to send a review of this apartment because it's so great I don't want anyone else to know about it. I've been visiting China for business for the past 15 years and I think this has been the most comfortable stay I've ever had in China.
  The apartment itself is comfortable, clean and has all amenities; stove & microwave oven, washer & drier.
  The location is even better. It is a 10-minute walk from the airport subway express & city subway lines. There are plenty of high-end and very inexpensive restaurants & also a 24-hour grocery between the apartment & subway station."
161902,"Robert and his place were both amazing. Due to the language barrier, I had trouble finding the place, so I called Robert and he came downstairs to meet me in front and helped me with my luggage up to the apartment. The apartment was exactly what I expected and looks just like it does in the photographs. The location is superb. Thank you, Robert! I hope this apartment is available for my trip next year!"
161902,Great Stay!  Robert was very helpful in getting me settled in and helping me on my way after my stay.  I had some rather complicated logistics getting out of Beijing and he definitely went out of his way to make sure they were taken care.  
161902,"Had a good stay at Robert's studio which was nicely furnished and complete with everything I needed including a fridge and washer & dryer which I took advantage of.  The apartment is very spacious with a comfortable bed and a desk that came in handy for accessing the Internet with the very fast wi-fi.  The location is super convenient as it is between two subway stations and with easy connection to the airport train.

Robert was particularly helpful in allowing me a late checkout.  I had checked in late and was leaving two days later also late.  When I asked Robert about a late check out he said he would try to arrange it and would get back to me the next morning.  Well he kept his word and got back to me in the morning with a positive answer.  That was awesome and demonstrated his willingness to help out.  Thanks Robert!"
161902,"We stayed in one of Robert's apartments for 16 days and it was a good home base for exploring Beijing.  The subway is about a five minute walk (line 2 or 13) and taxi rides to the heart of the city are cheap.  The apartment is showing its age, but has everything you need: fast Internet, strong hot water, good A/C, a washer and dryer, (though the drier takes a while), and a very comfy bed - a rare bonus in Asia!  The building is secure, we felt safe.   Robert responded quickly to all our communications and had full bottles of water delivered for the dispenser whenever we asked.  This is not a luxury apartment, but is a good value for the money.  We recommend it, and Robert as a host."
161902,"Nice place and great location. It's nothing super-fancy, but is a good deal for the price. Robert is very business-like and responded very quickly to any requests I had. I did see a couple cockroaches while I was staying there, though that's been the case in plenty of places I've lived in China. "
161902,"Wir waren mit Robert ganz besonders zufrieden. Er half uns bei allen unseren Wünschen. sei es das Besorgen einer Telefon pin u karte, bei der Subway-card und holte uns gegen Gebühr auch vom Flughafen ab. 
Das Appartment war sehr gut ausgestattet und wir konnten sogar W?sche waschen u. trocknen. Das Studio ist sehr ruhig, kein L?rm vom vielen Verkehr war zu h?ren. Die Lage ist ganz nah bei zwei Subway-Stationen und Essen und Shoppen kann man rundherum ganz toll.
Robert hat sich ganz reizend um uns gekümmert und wir kommen gerne wieder zu ihm nach Bejing."
161902,"The apartment is as advertised and the host, Robert, was responsive and helpful.  It comes with all of the basic essentials included, just bring your own bath soap.  The dryer at the apartment was running, but not drying anything when I was there, but that may be fixed for future guests.

The location of the apartment is excellent, basically right downtown and a short walk to a subway station.  On one of the alleys that borders the apartment complex there are a number of small, local convenience type stores that have drinks, snacks, etc, and a number of street food vendors which is quite convenient.  Also a short walk away you will find a full grocery store and dozens of restaurants. For those who are interested in nightlife, there is a famous bar/club district about 2 blocks away in the workers' stadium area."
161902,"Nice, clean functional apartment in Beijing.  Well located with near metro with bars and eateries within walking distance.  Recommended!"
161902,"The location was very convenient to the airport express and the subway which gets you to almost all the tourist attractions. The apartment was clean and bright, the bed and bedding comfortable. There was a small heat wave during our visit, so we really appreciated the efficient air-conditioning and the drinking water provided by the apartment owner. The kitchen was basic but we found such incredibly inexpensive little restaurants right behind the building for breakfast that we could not justify cooking! The restaurant on the ground floor was also pretty good, so we only used the fridge to store some fruit and pretty well just ate out. It is great to have laundry facilities. The owner is very responsive when we needed anything, so we highly recommend this rental. "
161902,"Great location! Very close to the subway for getting around Beijing easily.  The room was spacious, laundry was a plus, and wifi was helpful.  Since it is an apartment, there was smoke coming from another unit that lingered around the front door.  Robert was helpful and we were able to leave our bags with him after checking out and picked them up later in the day.  Overall, a pretty good stay.  Thank you!"
161902,"Robert was very helpful and on time. Good. Internet is good since you have your own PPOE router in the room. Use a VPN and it's even better. Room was clean, all the stuff we needed was there. Even have a drier (didn't tried it) Room was very hot but I could fix that problem with the air cond or open the access to the balcony.  I had 2 nice beds for the price. Water in the shower is sufficient. It's the best shower I got in a private appartment in China. The place was safe, location was great! .....
To be considered. Photo looks nice but the place is little older and fresh than the picture. Shower water goes all over the bathroom and makes it very wet. Towel quality is soso. Bed sheet are not the kind with elastic .. only one sheet on bed and one big over you. I think this can be arrange with Robert on your next stay. 
Overall for the price I paid and the location. I am satisfied."
161902,Cheap and clean apartment. Good location.
161902,"The apartment is fine and Robert has always responded to our requests. Location is great. Near a mall where you can buy anything you need. Close to the subway. Now, in order to help potential guests, I must say that the apartment needs some refurbishing, particularly in the bathroom that, by the way, could be cleaner!!! I think that Robert could also provide some extra utensils for the kitchen. We had just one knife, one glass of wine, no glasses at all, no mugs, no forks, etc. These things are really cheap in China, so I think Robert will not need too much money to turn the studio a little bit more comfortable. It would save much work also if the shower had a door. "
161902,"The apartment was nice, but extremely difficult to find. The directions and coordination with Robert before my arrival were poor at best to put it nicely. Would not recommend for that reason. Far from the best experience I've had on airbnb, and I've had quite a few. "
161902,"Robert was a wonderful host, and everything was as advertised. He was quick with his communication, and although i didnt encounter any problems, i know they would be dealt with right away if i had. The room was clean and internet fast. The location was great. I will definitely book with Robert again. A++++"
161902,"Staying at Roberts was good for all our six days. The neighborhood is filled with small shops, close to a metro and a good chance for a night out. "
161902,"Good location, very close to subway! Checkin was easy. Air conditioning was great, fast wifi. To find the entrance of the building just walk around the building to the back part and you will see the lobby. Close to Seven 11 and grocery store.
Would recommend! "
161902,"In reality the room didn't really look like the room shown in the picture (two beds, not working wardrobe, missing water dispenser): it was quite dirty when we arrived and kind of disgusting when we experienced that the toilet rubbish wasn't emptied. For the high price paid, one could expect at least a clean room.
But Robert Sun was insofar helpful whenever we had questions and after we informed him about the missing and broken stuff. Another plus is definitely the location: Close to Dongzhimen and Dongsishiqiao Station, the Airport Express, two big shopping malls and lots of nice and good tasting Chinese restaurants.

"
161902,"We had a pleasant stay in Beijing with Robert, he offered us a custom beijing day tour and we had so much fun thank you"
161902,"Fairly well-equipped apartment with reasonable facilities including efficient washing machine and dryer. However, it was scruffy and grubby, plus the directions to get there were incomplete which was difficult. This could be a great apartment if more effort was made by the owner."
161902,the room is not as good as it is on the picture. the price is sooooo expensive that it's nearly twice time of the price on (Website hidden by Airbnb) i will definitely not recommend this apartment to my friends. bad experience ever...
161902,房东人很好 但是 房源就是很普通的钟点房的感觉 和图片格局一致 但是完全没有图片的效果 类似普通宾馆 这个价格对于这个房源太高了 唯一欣慰就是 离地铁站5-10mins路程 在工人体育馆斜对面 再往里走五六百米
161902,"最恼人的是早上九点就有人敲门催促退房,明明是规定12点退房,还一直催要求11点就离开,就这一点就很过分?其它方面,虽然是临时定的,但房东回复很及时,入住也很方便顺利?地理位置如描述的一样便利,整栋公寓都比较旧,房间本身干净,各种设施都有,不过不是照片里的那一间,设施要陈旧和简陋一些,床垫特别不好,睡起来会塌,感觉弹簧已经都快不行了"
162144,"Pros:
Clean and decent sized room for four adults. Great location for walking and subway access. Plenty of restaurants, banks, shopping, and convenience stores within walking distance. Tv with plenty of channels and free wi-fi. A/C, washer, and dryer is a nice bonus. Robert is a good host who is friendly, responsive, and offers reasonably priced tours. 

Cons:
Shower could use a door or curtain. Would have been nice if the refrigerator worked. Beds are super firm, which I enjoyed but others did not.

Summary:
A good place to stay if you want to live outside of the touristy areas to experience how locals really live, yet still be close enough to visit all of the attractions in Beijing."
162144,"Very good location! One of central underground station is just about five minutes walk.
Good and friendly accommodation. Friendly and caring owner.
Very comfortable beds :) 24/7 security. Good noise insulation.

I suppose that this apartment is the best for visitor who doesn't want to spend much money but needs comfortable and well situated place for staying.

I'm going to stay here my next time in Beijing."
162144,"The room i stayed was not the same as i booked and is depicted on the Airbnb-site. In the room there was only one bed and a sofa, which was  to old and worn to be used as a bed. Furthermore, the bathroom was very dirty, hairs from previous guest were lying everywhere in the bathroom, especially under the bath mat. The kitchenett was old and dirty. Shower could use a door or curtain. WiFi was very slow (often about 2kb/s) and instable.  Pros:central location in a quiet and secure area, very near to subway station"
162144,"in renting such an affordable place in a city literally half way around the world from me i had more concerns than expectations. none of my concerns were realized. i worried about smells, bad lighting, noise, scary neighborhood.
the apt is clean and smelled totally neutral; the overhead lights had soft light compact fluorescents; with the patio door closed it was silent -- open, the street noises were distant; there was virtually no noise from other occupants. the neighborhood was fun, with restaurants and street activity. 
everything worked -- the heater, the hot water, the shower, the toilet, and the bed for westerners (from ikea). purified water was provided (a very nice touch) in a 5 gallon dispenser. the bed linens were nice. we didn't use the stove; our needs were taken care of by the electric tea kettle and microwave.
The owner-robert was always rapidly responsive, whether by email or phone. We used him as our guide and driver for fours days and he did a wonderful job. 
This apt. is a great value, way beyond its price. i would recommend this property to anyone going to beijing for more than a night or two, and we would stay there again in a heartbeat. "
162144,The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
162144,"Overall a very good experience staying in the apt. Robert is easy to communicate with and picked us up at the airport. No problems and a great ""home base"" to explore Beijing from. Especially liked being so close to the subway system and to great restaurants and shops.

Thanks!"
162144,"We are a couple from Sweden who during our travels prefer to live in an apartment and travel by public transpoty. For this purpose, was Robert′s apartment absolutely perfect! We rented one of the apartments, about 50 sqm, with two large beds. We felt very safe in the area and in the house. The view from the apartment is nothing special, but it does not matter because it meant that it was so increadibly quiet. The apartment was adequately equipped so that we could make our own breakfast. We also estimated the availability of washer and dryer. 
 
After two nights we asked if we could get two reading-lamps and as the kind and service-minded man Robert is, he arranged it immediately. Robert is a wonderful landlord, and it seemed like a great comfort. We knew that if we encounter a problem, he would do everything to help us.  We ate often at the restaurant on the ground floor. It was nice staff, good food, menus with pictures, cheap and close to home! We recommend the dessert with sesame paste, yummy!

We have some tips for your trip to Beijing;
Take with you a phrasebook, it is an invaluable help when almost no one speaks english, a guidebook in which all names and adresses are also in Chinese. Then you can always stop someone and show the Chinese text.
Bring a compass. This makes it tremendously more easier to navigate. 
Leave the camera and purse at home if you will look at Mao, otherwise you will not be admitted.
Visit the Tempel of Heavens park early in the morning and look at everything that happens.
Walk in the hutongs, say Nihao! and try to make contact.

Robert was easy to communicate with and very concerned about his guests. If you know you have problems with your backs, tell Robert, and he will arranges thicker mattresses. If you do not want to travel independently, you can hire Robert as a guide. We know that Robert is a very good driver, as he picked us up at the airport. We think it was absolutely perfect for us to hire Robert′s apartment and will definitely rent it again when we return to Beijing!"
162144,"The apartment was exactly what I acpected. There was anything you need:iron, waching machine, kitchen.
Robert is a nice person, who came at time."

162144,"I had a wonderful stay in Beijing . Robert Sun's apartment is an excellence choice for a visit in  Beijing. Just a few minutes walk to metro loop line 2 Dongsishiatao station. If you stay at any station near loop line , it is very convenience to go to any place in beijing. Dongzhimen express train station to a airport  is a mere 5 minutes walk. It is also near to sunlitun...a tourist area of beijing. Yashow market in sunlitun for me is the best tourist market in beijing. Apartment also provides everything if you like to prepare you own meal. For muslim , within walking distance you can get  chinese muslim  restaurents. For a guide if you are a first timer in beijing, you better use Robert's transportation from airport to apartment because it  may be difficult to find the place as all the signs  are in chinese. I also use Robert's for my visit to great wall.The apartment is clean and Robert was very responsive to all my needs.....simply best of beijing"
162144,"Overall we had a good stay in Robert's apartment. Location of the apartment is very convenient , quiet & safe.  the place is an easy walk from Dongzhimen station Line 2 & 13 and also a station for Airport Express. if you use the Airport express to Dongzhimen station, once arrive, go towards Line 2 subway station then take Exit C that goes to Ginza Mall. go thru Ginza Mall and exit near the i-Space store , at the main road turn right and walk straight. the apartment block is on the left side of the road.
Apartment is well kept, clean & spacious. 
Robert was very responsive whenever we request for anything.  
will stay in Robert Sun's apartment again in our next trip. "
162144,"We had a great stay in Beijing. The Apt. is perfectly adequate for 4 people. It is clean for Chinese standards and provides a good opportunity, to live inexpensive and centrally located in Beijing."
162144,"Nous apprécié l'accueil efficace, Robert a été disponible aussi bien pour nous accueillir que pour le départ; toujours joignable.
Le logement est simple, propre, utilitaire et bien placé. 

"
162144,the location is wonderful! and the place is very clean and cozy. Robert has been very helpful.
162144,Nice location to explore Beijing! Only 5 minutes walk to metro station.
162144,"Mr. Sun is very nice and responsive to our arrival and needs in the room.  We stayed for 5 nights, the washer and dryer are really great for the hot sticky Beijing weather.  The area is okay, convenient to subway and taxi and few local restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The fruit store at the back street of the bldg. is good, since we love all kinds of fruits.  The hallway going into the room is dark and unpleasant, but once you are inside the room, its OK, (not as nice as the picture).  Its clean enough, equipped with cup and dished and some utensils.  There is little leak from toilet, we notify Mr. Sun and he tried fixing it immediately, the leak is still there, but not enough to bother us.  Overall, we had a good stay.  "
162144,"四个人住正合适,就像公寓一样各项设施一应俱全,非常棒!位置也很好,离东四十条地铁站很近,而且楼下就有一家好吃的生煎包店~唯一需要改善的就是空调了,制冷效果一般~"
162144,房间和照片有点差距 但是地址不错 住着也还算舒服
162144,Nice place in the center of Beijing.  
162144,"交通和购物都很方便 ,房间也挺干净,不错的体验"
162144,Robert was a very helpful host. He also offered to drive us to see the Great Wall and gave us very reasonable rates (a lot cheaper than any tour company we spoke with) and took the time to drive us all the way out to the less crowded section farther from Beijing (2.5 hrs). The apartment we stayed at was a bit difficult to find--for future renters of that unit: be advised that you have to go through the lobby to the outside/back of the building and make an immediate left where you will see a security desk. The neighborhood is fine and you'll be near some local shops. There is a bank and ATM across the street to exchange money and a casual restaurant at the lobby of the apartment complex. 
162144,"Nice place, Robert was quick to resolve any issues we had. Close to train station, a little hard to find originally but he came and met us and took us to the building. Thanks for the stay"
162144,"the studio is worn out...beds are worn out, kitchen utensils not complete,...not worth for the money.
Felt insure in the room."
162144,"The best thing going for this studio flat - as advertised and commented by many - is the location. It is right near two subway stops (10 min walk), easy access to the old historic part (inside 2nd ring), as well as near the trendy east sanlitun area (places to go out, western or fancy food), plus right near the airport expressway train (15 min walk). 

The building and studio itself are nothing to write home about. They are reasonable enough, but the building a bit run down and the flat somewhat close to the picture, although a bit worn. Think of it as a 3 star Chinese hotel and your expectations will be in line. 

Price is also good value.

Robert is a good guy - quiet and not super outgoing, but responsive. We had a mix-up on the driver picking us up from the airport (driver did not show), so Robert picked up our cab fare.  Luckily I speak Mandarin, as arriving 11:30 at night with 3 kids may be daunting for many expats. We also had a bad shower head, which he replaced in 1 day; and we needed more folding chairs, which he got to right away.

The only issue was the flat was not clean when we first arrived. The maids did a minimal job on the exposed areas, but the closets and drawers were very dirty. Again, Robert offered to re-send the maids with us overseeing them, but my wife and I just preferred to roll up our sleeves and do it ourselves, as we have seen enough Chinese maids to know this isn't Japan or Spain levels of cleanliness.

We also stayed a month (kids went to a camp, I did a work project), and the fact everyone was happy and no one got sick, well I leave very happy. We also had 2/4 weeks with blue sky in Beijing, so that also colored my experience in a positive way."
162144,"房间挺大的,四个人住一点也不显得挤,外面有阳台,晒衣物也挺方便,房东还配备了洗衣液刀具衣架伞等一系列生活又用品,非常的有心,感谢感谢!房屋地段也很好!赞!"
162144,"Robert was great and extremely helpful. He was very nice and communicated well. He also helped store our bags for us when we wanted a late checkout. The place wasn't as nice as what the picture showed, but we appreciated the drinking water, washer/dryer, safe quarters, and also there were a lot of outlets which was great. I would definitely stay at this place again if I come to Beijing again!"
162144,"房源的地段很不错,楼下的店早餐很好吃哦,不远处就是工体很方便,好评哦"
162144,"房子地段很好,稍有些显旧,房间很大,住四个人也会拥挤?老板态度很好!"
162144,Robert is very nice guy he give lots help when we check in. the apartment is quiet clean and cozy and the apartment is next to the shopping mall and street of snack it also between several different underground location easy for travel and shopping.  I definitely recommend his apartment.  thank you for let us stay in your apartment .
162144,"房子的地理位置还不错,去别的地方比较近,但进到楼层有点脏乱,感觉干什么的都有,房间里面就像图片展示那样,不大不小吧,不过只有几点不好,床单的质量不太好(有点磨人),枕头好像也有点味道,还有就是花洒水压可以调高点,别的设施都还挺齐全,洗衣机干衣机冰箱什么的都有,总体也就还好吧,胜在地理位置较好,设施较多吧?"
162144,Very close to subway station to get around Beijing. Neighbourhood seems to be a bit run down or an old area however the accomodation is nice inside. Robert offered airport transfer as out flight arrived very late at night which was very helpful. 
162144,"The room is super clean and tiny, although it's a bit difficult to find the actual location but overall experience is good. Will recommend to friends."
162144,"good location, near from subway station.
Lots of places to eat around there"
162144,Great location!
162144,The apartment is very well located.
162144,"Great value for this room, I highly recommend it for short stays in Beijing."
279078,"Fiona is a terrific girl. Very professional, great communicator and accommodating. I was very happy to have found a place at this very convenient, clean, efficient and comfortable expat community. Will be staying here again!"
279078,"Great apartment in excellent location close to shops, restaurants and subway. Apartment has amazing amounts of storage. Would definitely consider staying here again if I return to Beijing.
Staff were very helpful and called for help when their English did not quite understand what I was saying. Highly recommended apartment."
279078,"Never, ever stay with ""Fiona."" She is not actually an individual renting an apartment, but the head of a poorly managed Chinese property management company. You don't even get the room you take time selecting online, but just whatever room they have available. So that was the first lie. Had I known it was a pseudo-hotel/rental agency, I would never have booked, so I felt really manipulated and irritated.

 I rented a room for my boss for 3 weeks while he was in town for a business trip. The first night, she told me that they didn't have a room for him because she let other guests extend their stay, even though I had booked a reservation through Airbnb! Her response was ""Sorry, nothing I can do."" Luckily, my boss's flight was delayed and by the second day when he arrived FIona was able to get a room for him.  She never refunded us for that first night. Because she gave away the room we booked, she said she could give him a temporary apartment (an upgraded suite), but that he'd have to move in three days because we hadn't paid for a suite but a normal room. I refused, and I had to fight with her to agree not to move. She wanted to refund us for the whole stay instead and didn't understand that rebooking another place on such short notice would also have been extremely inconvenient.

Lastly, my boss kept getting notices every day on his door that the electricity was unpaid and would be cut off, so I had to call Fiona multiple times to get her to pay it. 

WORST Airbnb experience ever. She should be banned from the site. I absolutely do not recommend that anyone ever stay with her."
279078,"Fiona is great, and the place is just like it is in the pictures. I would highly recommend this pace."
279078,"what a wonderful place. Has all the amenities of a top class residence hotel including washing machine but for some strange reason no fridge - or hidden fridge. The location is fantastic, really convenient and even has a good swimming pool that I sadly had no time to use. I would  gladly stay there again if they would accept me again :)
many thanks
Philippe"
279078,"The apartment is very clean  and all equipments are in order including the wifi, but there is an midunderstanding about the no of guest and rooms needed. Host said it was not clearly notified by  airbnb  ( asked for room and not specified no of guests ) and airbnb said it was the host and i am not any wiser even now. The location is very good and got good access to subway, public buses though the front entrance is hard to find easpecially at night.  Good restaurants and shops within walking distance."
279078,"Very nice! Very good location , silent apartament, good residence. We are happy of our choice. We had washing machine, a little fridge, a very little kitchen and everything works!!
Fiona si always ready to help you. 
"
279078,"Excellent location - walking distance to Sanlitun, restaurants, bars, and Dongzhimen subway station.  Good experience over my 2 week stay and Fiona was always quick to respond to any inquiries. "
279078,The place was fine for the money but directions to this apartment were difficult.  It was fairly clean and in a huge complex of other condo's.  Overall I would say a 6 out of 10.
279078,"my family had a good time in the apartment. the location is convenient, there are restaurants nearby. the room is clean and the cleaning service is good. the staff at the reception is helpful. "
279078,"It was nice, clean and good loacation."
279078,"The apartment is really nice and confortable. You get everything you need plus an amazing view. I haven't got the chance to meet Fiona, but was welcomed with of colleague of hers. Although he was not able to speak English, he proved very keen to help in any possible way. Thank you "
279078,"Just okay.  The location is really good, on the plus side -- close to the Airport Express, metro and Sanlitun.  The apartment is about big enough for one person or a couple.

Communication, though, wasn't great.  This is a company that rents out serviced apartment, so the check in information has some strange copy-and-pasted stuff about deposits.  It was only the day before, when I asked, that I was told I had to come to an office, not the apartment, to get the key.  Once at the office, though, Fiona and the staff were friendly and it was smooth enough.  A lot of walking though - in bad weather it would not have been pleasant.

The apartment is kept clean, and decently stocked with amenities.  It is a bit worn, though, and one of the windows didn't seem to open.

All in all - if most other things are full, or location is everything, then not a bad option, but wouldn't be top of my list."
279078,"很好的一次入住体验,交通很方便,服务很贴心,环境很幽静,赞一个"
279078,"The place is essentially what you see in the pictures. The view is great, you get to see a part of the Dongzhimen district. Other then a few water marks around the lower bathroom wall and near the door, the place was great! I would definitely stay again! "
279078,"Clean room, very accommodating and responsive host, very convenient location. Thanks for a great stay!"
279078,"The Good
- Location is good. 
- If you lower your expectations the apartment is fine. 
- Was always able to get in touch with Rich&Young company when needed and they helped as much as possible with the big problems. 


Bad
- Fiona not there to meet as others have said. She was ""at the hospital”. Wouldn’t have been an issue as other staff where available but the move in wasn’t particularly smooth. I would have appreciated Fiona there to help deal with the problems. 
- 1st Apartment not as advertised. Was dirty, toilet flusher broken, no cable tv etc. 
- 2nd apartment TV didn’t work and not too clean.
- 3rd apartment was OK and I stayed in this one.  
- Iron didn’t work. When told Fiona about problem nothing happened to fix it so didn’t have ironed clothes for a month. 
- Advertised Cable TV: It is Chinese cable tv so don’t expect CNN, HBO, etc. More Chinese channels. 
- Advertised GYM: There is a gym but it is 70RMB (12USD) per visit. It is not included in price. Half the machines are broken. It is a 5-10 min walk to the gym. 
- Cold in winter. Heating wasn’t turned on. Was cold. 
- Fridge door didn’t close properly so I always felt it never really got cold enough inside and things went off early. 

Conclusion
If you want a place for a short period, like a month, to use then it is OK. It is good location and I was happy there. If your willing to pay a premium and get a basic, modern, clean apartment then I recommend it. However, don’t expect the photos and don’t expect the AirBNB treatment you're used to. This is a money generating business and you will feel it in what is provided in the apartment and the service you receive. "
279078,"Bait and switch. Basically I didn't get the place advertised. When I got there I was the standard 1br at Season's Park. If you've been to Season's Park before you'll know they all look alike and look nothing like these pictures. When I asked them why it wasn't as advertised they told me (probably not true) that someone extended their stay at the advertised place and they were giving me a free ""upgrade"" to the 1br. It's all BS. Unfortunately there was no other options for me at that hour. Great location near Sanlitun but just over promised and under delivered. Typical. "

282825,"During April 2012 we stayed at Ray's & Florence place for 17 days to explore Beijing .
 Since English was a key issue – we looked for an apartment which the
  owner is fluent with the language. Ray and Florence were the answer to 
  our prayers!!
Ray & Florence  are nice & warm persons who gave us a lot of attention
  and helped  with all our needs. 
The apartment and the kitchen were very well equipped. Kitchen is well equipped with range of utensils including a fridge & stove.  We've been provided with clean towels and bed linen,
 Rooms were cozy, with electronic A/C temperature control. There were
  two very nice bathrooms and constantly supply of hot water.
We found that the flat was conveniently located, close to 2 subway lines
  and a city center, but  Still in a very quiet neighborhood.
Shopping for groceries was a short walk to nearby supermarket  Tourist 
 attractions about ten minutes subway drive.

Staying in their flat was a wonderful experience for us! We really enjoyed
 the comfort and Ray’s kindness explaining everything we needed to
 know about the apartment.

We would definitely stay at their place if we are going to Beijing in the future.

Highly recommended!!! 
"
282825,"Myself and a friend stayed in this lovely apartment for 5 nights. Couldn't have asked for much more. Location excellent, and the apartment itself is modern and furnished beautifully. The use of the bikes made our beijing experience a richer one as well. I would absolutely recommend this place to stay to anyone!"
282825,"We stayed in the apartment for 10 days in May. A family of 4. It was just GREAT! The apartment is very comfortable, modern, completely furnished and yet very homey and cozy.
The location is perfect, close to the center (not a trivial thing in a city like Beijing), with all the facilities within walking distance (bars, markets, groceries, cafes, restaurants, etc.)
Ray and Florence are very nice and helpful hosts. It really, really contributed to our trip being great!. Thank you. I will recommend this place anytime. "
282825,Lovely Apartment and much nicer than the photos.  Awesome views from the 14th floor and very clean and modern.   I stayed with my brother and it was so nice to have 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.  I really loved the space and the location was ideal.  Ray & Florence were great hosts and offered loads of help and advice.  I would stay here again the next time I am in town.
282825,The reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
282825,"Staying at Ray and Florence's place was great. Its in one of the best areas in Beijing, convenient to lots of expat amenities including bars and restaurants, but also parks and good grocery stores. We loved our stay there. We miss the urban view from the bedroom and the wonderful shower in the master bath! Ray and Florence were great hosts. They helped us get oriented with a walk around the neighborhood and helped with logistics like registering with the PSB. I will definitely check their availability the next time we're in Beijing!"
282825,"My family and I stayed at Ray and Florence's apartment for 3 nights. We had a blast in Beijing and give Ray and Florence the highest recommendation! All of us agree that should we return to Beijing, we would stay at Ray and Florence's place in a heartbeat. We will be telling any friends who travel to Beijing to stay here. 

The apartment itself was beautifully decorated. It was clean with western style showers and very safe. The location was perfect for tourist activities, public transportation, and the expatriate area (bars, restaurants, shopping). Taxi to Tian'anmen square/Forbidden City/Wangfujing was about 20rmb or 2rmb on the subway. We even tried scorpion on a stick at Wangfujing!

All in all, the apartment was much better than staying in a hotel. Ray and Florence were great hosts, helping us set up airport transfer, giving us a tour of the neighborhood, and booking a private driver to take us to the Great Wall. They gave us so many tips on where to go and what to do during our stay that we wished we would have planned more time to see the city which they both know so well. If you are touring China, stop here first, Ray and Florence are knowledgable about many other cities in China as well. 

If you have the chance to stay at Ray and Florence's apartment, do not pass it up - it is perfect for short or long stays. Two of us have travelled to Beijing a number of times in the past but this trip has far exceeded previous stays in Beijing. Great place and wonderful people!"
282825,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic! Ray and Florence are great hosts and helped us out with a driver from the airport and to the Great Wall. The beds are comfy, kitchen has everything you need and bathrooms are super clean. I will recommend that anyone I know who goes to Beijing stays with them. It is a great base to go anywhere in the city and all necessities are nearby! Hope to stay with you again in the future!!! "
282825,"We had a wonderful time at Ray and Florence's apartment.  It is well set up, very warm (we were there in the winter) and has a great view.  Loved having the water cooler/heater.  It's a great area to stay - because there is a substantial consulate community the locals are used to seeing foreigners.  Lots of good restaurants and shops. Ray and Florence were helpful and accommodating.  We felt at home while we were there and would stay again without hesitation."
282825,"A very nice appartement, well located, well equiped with all furniture very clean and good quality. Congratulations for your decoration,  and with our two children we quickly feell very well as ""at home"" in this large and quiet appartement .  It is surounded by all necessary super marmarkets, for foreigners or not, and not far from subway station of line 2 ( the most useful for us). The contact with Ray and Florence were always very kind and helpful by email, and their friend gives us a reliable help for Taxi. Neighboors and the day & night guard are always nice. We do hope to stay in contcat with them and have the opportunity to rent again this appartment. "
282825,"We- a family with two adult daughters- had a wonderful stay at Rays apartment. He was in the apartment when we arrived an gave us lots of useful information abut Beijing, food, restaurants and sights worth to visit.
Florence showed us the surroundings. The apartment was very well equipped. We had everything what we needed. But we didnt cook there. No matter there are many restaurants nearby -worth its money.
Before our visit to Beijing we had e-mail contact. There were always fast answers. We asked for a coffee machine. It was provided. 
Thanks a lot, Ray and Florence.
Manfred "
282825,"Ray and Florence was very helpful all the way through, we had a lovely time in Beijing and one of the main reasons was our accommodation. A cosy flat with enough space to be together in the logo room or read a book in one of the bedrooms. Florence helped us out with the basics when we arrived, both with registrations and pointing out some nearby sweet-spots. I can really recommend staying at Florence and Ray's. "
282825,"Ray & Florence are the MUST STAY Beijing hosts. 

The apartment is very nice & you will have everything that you need to make your stay comfortable. Lots of little touches including pre printed instructions for cab drivers to the apartment. I would recommend using the airport car pick up arrangement that he has. Worked very smoothly for my 10.30 pm arrival. Also use the same facility for the Great Wall trip - recommended.

the location is very central within  $ 5 cab ride to most attractions & around a 10-12 min walk to the subway.

But the key difference is really the hosts. They lived in US & have the international perspective of China as well as the local perspective. It was great chatting with them. They are extremely helpful. Ray walked me around the immediate neighborhood & gave me an orientation & even helped me choose a restaurant & order my first meal in China. 

 Also there was a. Mistake I made while booking the apartment which meant I was supposed to pay a little more than I actually had paid. He waived this amount and it was clear that they don't do this for the money only. They enjoy meeting people & enjoy hosting them.

If you get a chance to be hosted by Ray & Florence, don't give it up.

"
282825,"This was a great find. They organised a pick-up at the airport for 200 yuan. So nice not to have deal with taxis after a long flight. We missed the connection in Shanghai, texted Florence and she rescheduled the pickup.
The location is superb. Within walking distance to the bars, restaurants and bargain shopping of Sanlitun. The metro is a bit of a walk but if you are tired or lazy taxis are very cheap. 
The building is fairly new with 24 hoor doorman and 2 lifts. The apartment itself is great. Very good accommodation at a reasonable price. Spacious and tastefully decorated - quality furniture and appliances.
Florence and Ray are extremely friendly and helpful and provided us with lots of information and advice. They live in the same building one floor above which is very convenient.
I would recommend this apartment to everybody."
282825,"I had a great stay at Florence's place! It's only a five-minute-walk to the Sanlitun bar area & there are lots of shops, restaurants, coffee places and supermarkets around. The building has a 24-hour-security service, so I felt totally safe. The apartment itself is really nice & bright -  I enjoyed the view from the 14th floor every day! "
282825,"The apartment is amazing, spacious and bright, with windows in all the rooms. Florence is a very cordial person, meeting us at arrival and waking up early morning to say good-bye at our departure.  It felt good to come back from our trips at our 'home away from home' . 
"
282825,"Great appartment in a nice neighborhood in Beijing. walking distance from shopping, and from metro stations. 
Florence is a great host, very nice and always ready to help (finding your way around, translating, etc..).
 "
282825,"Lovely, large, clean, lots of light in a very ""in"" part of Beijing.
Ray was great in Florence's absence.
Thoroughly recommended."
282825,"Great apartment, great location just as advertised. I would highly recommend this place! :) "
282825,"Wow! What a beautiful apartment! Comfortable with huge windows all around with great views, it is spacious, charming, beautifully decorated. We stayed there for ten days and were sad to leave. We will miss Florence who is an amazing host. There is nothing she did not do to make our stay in Beijing an easy and positive experience. She is warm and kind, helpful, very knowledgeable, fluent in 3 languages, you could not dream of a better host to introduce you to Beijing.  She was great helping us to find fun things to do with our two young children, my daughter still talks about her! The area is perfect. Very close to western supermarkets, shops, restaurants, a very cheap clothes market. Anything you may want or need is nearby. Not far from the underground train as well. The water bottles are provided and the garbage is taken down for you, which saves you lots of trips in the lift. The aircon is ducted, there are two bathrooms, the beds are comfortable, we cooked most of our meals as the kitchen is pleasant to use with a gas oven and a microwave and lots of pans. I really can't think of anything that was not perfect. The only bad thing is that we had to leave!
"
282825,Florence and her apartment were both great! Everything we needed was there and she was willing to help us with anything! Definately would stay at Florence's next time as well. 
282825,"Perfect place, perfect flat, very helpful owner.
Will be back on regular base as it is a perfect location to stay for my business activities and also enjoy Beijing booming life
Thanks"
282825,"Great location in the heart of the city. Apartment is spacious and clean. Shops and restaurants within walking distance as the ad says.

 Hosts were were very welcoming and helpful. They directed me to a great tour when I enquired of the Great Wall. And the tour office was just two blocks from the apartment. 

Hosts are in the same building and if you need directions to get anywhere it is good having them close.   Also providing a bike to use while staying was another attraction. Best way to be a tourist is with a bike in my opinion.

A great place to see Beijing from."
282825,"I stayed at Florence and Ray's place in Beijing for 3 weeks in October while taking a Mandarin program nearby. The apartment was large, comfortable and very conveniently located. The neighborhood offers the best of two worlds. Walk a few blocks in one direction and you'll find the ex-pat world of Sanlitun and all its bars, restaurants, and shops. Walk a few blocks the other way, and you're in an authentic Beijing neighborhood, surrounded by Beijing families who call this place home. Everything you could possibly need is right at hand (supermarket, dry cleaner, cheap eats) and best of all, Florence and Ray are fantastic people who are as welcoming, friendly and helpful as one could hope for."
282825,"This is a really nice apartment, perfectly furnished and in a very good location. Florence and Ray are very nice hosts and always helpful. I enjoyed my stay there and will certainly come back."
282825,"After living in Beijing for 8 years we were looking for a home away from home for our remaining and busy last 2 weeks - and we found it!
Florence and Rays Apartment is in a great location, very nice decorated, spacious and offers beautiful views. It offers all ammenities, is clean and very comfortable. We only met Florence and she is a great host! 
We hope to be able to return soon for a vacation and have recommended it to our friends. Thanks Florence and Ray for your hospitality!"
282825,The apartment is in a great location and was clean. Would definitely recommend staying here!
282825,"It was my first experience with airbnb and, if it is always like that, I will always travel in this way. Amazing apartment with everything, clean, well located and what to say about Florence... really a nice person, friendly, helpful with everything and much more.
I have to say that might be the best place I've ever stayed."
282825,"This is a fabulous apartment in a great location. Within a couple of blocks you have a wide variety of Chinese food, a European grocery and a Texas BBQ restaurant. It's within walking distance to the Silk Market and many other venues of interest. The apartment has everything you need and the hosts are great.  Spacious, comfortable and way better than a hotel if you want to make your own food. Well located and safe. Tops all round. Within reach of all the tourist areas and plenty of help from Florence. Reasonable price too."
282825,"This property is very well located within Beijing, and although not exactly a stone's throw from the Forbidden City but a 10-30 minute taxi ride from almost anywhere you might wish to go. The actual locality is rich in shops, markets, bars and restaurants, both Chinese and western. The flat is spacious and graciously furnished, and Florence herself could not have been more helpful. Like the city itself, this is definitely a place to visit again, and highly recommended."
282825,"What can I say about Florence and her place that hasn't already been said?! The location is fantastic, walking distance to all the best night life in Beijing. The apartment itself is a real home from home, has everything your could wish for and more. The communication was excellent, answered all my questions and provided helpful advice. Shame we didn't have the time to sit down and have cup of tea! Florence and Ray are a true credit to airbnb! Hope to see you next time I'm in Beijing. "
282825,"It was wonderful staying at florence's flat, Florence and Ray are both kind and friendly. it is located in one of the most trendy part of Beijing, amazing view on the 14th floor. It is comfortable and fully equipped with lots of everything you need in the house. There is a real handy western supermarket and little restaurants in the basement of the shopping mall next to the building, and plenty bars and restaurants nearby too! If i was to add anything to note, is that the internet is a bit temperamental. However, this is something we could totally live without for a few days while enjoying a holiday in Beijing :) "
282825,"We had really nice time in Beijing and appartment was super! Location, the size of the appartment and of course very helpful host, Florence! She had good tips for us about neighbourhood and Beijing in general. Also, she took us straight away to leave our info for local police (that's good to do in China when your not staying in hotel). Owners even invited for a drink, but unfortunately we had too busy schedule, but it only means that there must be a second time visit here later! We definitely recommend!"
282825,"Florence, wow your apartment is probably the best choice in the entire Beijing. The apartment is beautiful and clean. The area however is the best area in town. Airport is close by, shopping around the corner, all clubs in walking distance and a very nice Chinese corner restaurant just down the road...... All in all, nothing better available"
282825,"Nuestra estancia en casa de Florence y Ray fue perfecta. Nos consiguieron todo tipo de comodidades, incluso habiéndolas solicitado casi sin antelación. Se han portado muy muy bien con nosotros. El apartamento tiene un ubicación estupenda. Es un sitio altamente recomendable y desde luego si vuelvo a Beijing, volveré a contactar con ellos. "
282825,"What can I say? I'm a heavy Airbnb user and this was one of my best experiences!! Florence and her husband are so nice and helpfull. The department is amazing completly equiped and perfectly located. Clean and huge! I'll stay again there in my next trip to Beijing. You have everything close by, bars, restaurants, grocery stores and the best Beijings Restaurant the DaDong  at 200mts"
282825,"C'était notre première fois avec airbnb et nous avons vraiment apprécié notre expérience! L'appartement de Florence est propre, très éclairé, magnifiquement décoré, inspirant et bien situé. à deux minutes à pied, il y a de tout: resto, boucherie, épicerie fine.  Le plus extraordinaire est la gentillesse et la générosité de Florence et son mari. Florence nous a donné d'excellents conseils, nous a été d'une aide précieuse dans nos démarches et a été adorable avec nos trois enfants! Nous aurions aimé avoir eu plus de temps pour discuter avec eux et les connaitre davantage.
Nous recommandons fortement la location de cet appartement!
élise, Patrick, Laurence, Charles et Louis

It was our first time with airbnb and it was a really good experience!
The apartment is neat, has plenty of light, beautifully decorated  and very well located. It's close to nice restaurants, a fine grocery and a french butchery.
Florence and her husband are extraordinary nice and generous! Florence gave us lots of goop advices and was lovely with our three kids!
We would love to spend more time talking with them!
We strongly recommended this apartment!
Elise, Patrick, Laurence, Charles and Louis."
282825,"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour à Pékin chez Florence. Son appartement est bien situé, dans le quartier de Sanlitun. Il est vaste, très lumineux et vraiment très bien meublé et aménagé ce qui fait qu'on s'y sent très vite chez soi et qu'on a hate de le retrouver le soir. Florence et Ray nous ont très bien accueillis et nous ont aussit?t réglé les vélos qu'ils nous ont prêtés. Je recommande vraiment l'appartement de Florence. "
282825,"We had a great experience at Florence and Ray's apartment. The space and design of the apartment was very good, it worked quite well for our family. We only prepared simple breakfast and snacks but there were some ingredients in the kitchen in case you wanted to do more (ie: garlic, spices, etc.). The location was quite ideal. Just a 5 minute walk from a well stocked, Western focused grocery store, as well as some small restaurants surrounding. As well as a 15 minute walk to a busy street with Malls and more restaurants, including Duck de Chine, a nice restaurant for Peking Duck. We didn't use the subway as we had a driver/guide but other posts indicate it's about a 15 min walk as well. We would definately stay here again and recommend it to others. Florence was also available at any point to answer questions, very helpful!"
282825,"This was simply one of the greatest AirBnB experience we had. 
The flat was fantastic, well equipped, silent, extremely comfortable, and even bigger than what the pictures show, and perfect for a family of four (two large bedrooms + two bathrooms). It is also ideally located in a very nice district, close to all kinds of shops and restaurants. 
Florence, our host, was extraordinarily useful and available, and gave us many useful indications and great sopts and places to visit / eat / shop / walk. 
Overall, it was a perfect stay in Beijing, and I would definitely recommend Florence and her fantastic flat !
"
282825,We had a very nice visit in Beijing. The apartment was in a perfect location for our needs. It is well laid out. I spent a lot of time in the apartment during the day for my own work. It is very comfortable. Florence was a terrific host.
282825,Great location in Beijing.  If you are into nightlife and shopping it's the right place to be. Hosts were very friendly and nice. They helped to arrange a car and were very helpful.  I would definitely recommend this place!
282825,"This apartment is amazing and we will recommend it to everyone we know who travels to Beijing.  It is near the Embassy District so the area has a comfortable for westerners vibe.    Ray and Florence provided maps as well as tear sheets with directions to the apartment in Chinese, great for taxi drivers.  Their suggested a nice drive to travel to the Great Wall and for airport pickup and drop off.    Ray is clearly a busy man, but he made sure to check in with us and provide restaurant recommendations. "
282825,"This is a really unique apartment in Beijing where you could enjoy the location, the view, and the host hospitality. Enjoy Florence and Ray are not at Beijing during my stay, everything is organized and prepared in perfect condition. If you come to Beijing to stay at Airbnb, you will not find better one than here. Thanks to Florence and Ray, also the Ayi. "
282825,"Florence and her husband were great hosts, always quick to respond to questions or queries both before and during our stay, and helpful right through out our six week in Beijing. Florence's tour of the neighbourhood, including help with registering our visit at the local police station on our first day was really useful and, because we stayed for a longer period, she also organised her super-efficient Ayi to do a regular clean, and top up our fresh water supplies regularly. It was very handy to have Florence and Ray in the apartment directly above. They had us up for drinks one evening, and kept us informed regularly if they were away or on a few occasions when some tradesmen were required to fix a small electrical problem in the apartment. They are lovely people, prepared to give their guests plenty of privacy but on hand if you need them. 
The apartment itself was homely, beautifully decorated and filled with natural light. Our family of three felt very comfortable there and we would definitely stay again. "
282825,"Everything positive about Florence & Ray and their wonderful apartment has been said and we are in total agreement.  Not only was the place fully furnished but it was fully decorated with Asian rugs, tapestries, weavings, original art, artifacts from various countries, and was so vibrant that it was a joy to see everyday.

Florence & Ray were genial and helpful hosts giving us many hints on eateries, sights to not miss, and navigating the Beijing streets on their nice bicycles.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would love to return."
282825,We loved staying at Florence and Ray's apartment - it felt just like home! Florence and Ray also made us so welcome and especially helped make our stay with an infant son really easy. The apartment was lovely and so comfortable. We had a great time during our stay and hope we can stay again if we return to Beijing in the future. Thanks so much!
282825,"Great apartment, great location. The apartment was very clean and cozy. Even on very cold days the heating is really good. Florence is a very good host and can give you good tips and connections if you like to travel around Beijing (e.g. Great Wall). Enjoyed our stay at Florence apartment very much!
"
282825,"Nous avons passé 8 jours dans l'appartement de Florence dans le quartier de Salitun à Beijing. L'accueil de Florence à été formidable et chaleureux avant notre arrivée et durant notre séjour. L'appartement est très confortable, très bien équipé et bien situé. Nous recommandons cette adresse pour un séjour dans la capitale chinoise, notamment pour des familles."
282825,"Florence was a wonderful host. The apartment is indeed very spacious, the rooms are huge and tastefully decorated. The art on the walls is amazing - definitely relaxes you after a hectic day of sight-seeing. The beds are comfortable and the showers are great. Florence took the time to show us around the apartment, made sure we had everything we needed like towels, extra blankets (it was very cold at the time), hot water, tea and coffee. She was gracious enough to take time out and walk us around the neighbourhood - even making a reservation for us at a wonderful neighbourhood Beijing duck restaurant. The neighbourhood is wonderful, lots of restaurants to choose from, with varied Chinese cuisines. We were sorry to have been there only 2 days, would have loved to try all the options. 

We will definitely be back and have already recommended Florence's place to friends who are thinking about visiting Beijing! "
282825,"Okay, you can ponder where to stay no further... Florence's place is your place to stay in Beijing. My boyfriend and two friends had a wonderful time at her apartment. Florence was more than great to communicate with and even helped out with a very last minute request to hire a car and driver to visit the great wall... that was some unbelievable super-host awesomeness.  
The apartment itself is amazing... comfortable, homey,  an all around a great spot in the city. The queen master bed / bedroom are perfect for a couple and the two bed quest room was perfect for our two friends. 
Her husband Ray popped by a few times to help us get acquainted with the apartment and local neighborhood. The beds are comfy and showers worked well. We'd definitely stay with Florence again the next time we visit Beijing. 
"
282825,"This place is great! Florence and her family are very nice and are helpful hosts. They had great directions in getting around, along with other helpful hints, tips, suggestions and recommendations. They were available to us as we needed! Plus, the place is as described and worked well for my family's trip to Beijing. The only thing I found as a negative would be the location in relation to the popular sights in town, although it's a beautiful area of town with many restaurants, shopping and more of it's own. We found the metro a bit inconvenient from here, while taking a taxi was expensive and time consuming with all the traffic. I would definitely recommend this place to others, but I'm not sure I would stay in this area of town again - would rather somewhere a bit more central."
282825,Great place and great hosts in a great neighborhood. Would highly reccommend! 
282825,Florence was very helpful during my trip to Beijing. She was able to accommodate an extra night stay despite the short notice! Her knowledge of the SanLiTun neighbourhood is quite impressive also! She took me on a one hour tour and showed me some of the best restaurants in the area and things to do. Definitely recommended! 
282825,"from the first contact, Florence was very helpful and supportive, especially for us Beijing-Greenhorns a huge advantage. Thanks to her arrival package, it was perfectly easy for the taxi driver to the find the house. The apartement is huge, bright and comfortable and has a great view. It was very clean and optimally useable for a failiy of 4 (or two couples, as well). Florence and her husband were always available with tips and support, and we even had a private tour through the neighborhood!
All n all: PERFECT!"
282825,"Nous avons séjourné chez Florence avec nos 2 enfants pour 4 jours : l'appartement est très grand et très bien agencé pour une famille de 4 personnes. Florence nous a accueillit avec beaucoup de conseils pour visiter Pekin et nous a même organisé la visite de la Grande Muraille qui nous a permis de la visiter dans de très bonnes conditions.
A noter pour les familles avec enfants : les stations de metro sont assez loin de l'appartement."
282825,"We had a great time at Florence and Ray's apartment. The apartment was amazing, very comfortable and in a good location. Florence and Ray were very helpful, helping us plan our time in the city, giving tips and even checking out things for us. 
we want to thank you for the pleasant stay.
Aliza, Ilana and Maya
"
282825,"This is a very nice apartment in a great part of town. Florence had fresh flowers out to greet us and a few things in the refrigerator to get us started. There are a number of options for groceries and great restaurants and shopping convenient to this location. thanks!
"
282825,"非常非常棒的首次airbnb体验,房子一级棒!干净,有品味而且出入方便,房东非常的贴心,提供了我们最大的便利!不愧是超赞房东,极力推荐!可惜最后一天跑得匆忙没当面感谢,希望下次还有机会,谢谢!"
282825,"Very nice house, feels like sleeping in gallery! Location is excellent, 5mins walk to Sanlitun, the nearest shopping mall is only 1 mins walking distance!
"
282825,"Staying in Florence apartment was a real pleasure. Already in advance Florence gave us a lot of hints and tips for our trip to Beijing. She warmly welcomed us and gave us a lot of advices for bars restaurants and sightseeing - which were really helpful. The apartment itself is quite large for us 4 people. With two bathrooms there was never a problem. Also the apartment was clean and lovely decorated. There was also groceries provided, like milk, butter, a fresh bread and so on, which was really nice because one did not needed to directly go to a store to get everything. Although the apartment is located in a very nie area, with plenty of grocery stores, bars, restaurants and shopping malls. Overall I can highly recommend a stay in Florence apartment and I would not hesitate to come back!  "
282825,"My second stay at the apartment was as comfy and smooth as the first one. Being busy with work during the day, I enjoyed the calm and space of the apartment in the evening. The location is great, with lots of restaurants and nice places around to explore. I highly recommend this place! "
282825,"Awesome location, very cozy apartment, and an extremely thoughtful and responsible host!"
282825,Very comfortable apartment. Well-equipped and an ideal location for the heart of trendy Beijing in Sanlitun. Florence lives above and is always on hand to address any problems. About a 15 minute max walk to the tube. We very much enjoyed our stay here.
282825,"As always, it was a pleasure to stay at Florence s place. Love to come back next time!"
282825,"Florence and Ray are the perfect hosts. They provide good and helpful information in advance and along the way, and help with whatever is needed. The apartment is very convenient and worked well for two adults and two children. It's easy to give them the best advice and good luck wishes for the new year."
282825,"Florence & Ray are the best host we could find in Beijing, probably in China. It was very nice long stay for us, the couple were very supportive to us and extremely efficient for all our requests. 

The location is perfect for shopping and dinning (western & all different style of Chinese cuisines) in Beijing, walking distance to apple store, cinema, it is very practical when Beijing traffic is so bad.

There were kids play centre at worker's stadium & the department store (walking distance) next door to the apartment building, it made parent life a bit easier.

Cheers Florence & Ray,  we will be back!


"
282825,"Host was very communicative by email before and during, especially since she could not be there in person. She arranged for someone else to greet us and show us around the place. Email was always available if a problem. Place was beautiful. Plenty of room, good kitchen, lovely art, comfortable. amazing views, very well located near everything in the city. nice to have the washing machine, and clothes dried quickly on the rack! Dishwasher was a plus also. Beds comfortable. room for everything. Doorman was very friendly. Highly recommend. "
282825,It was a pleasure to stay at Florence′s place again! Highly recommend it.
282825,Everything we needed and always on hand if needed.
282825,Florence's place feels like home!
282825,Very nice apartment. It is very convenient in sanlitun. You can get everything and go shopping by walking.
282825,Love the apartment. The location is great and the apartment offers everything we need as a home away from home. Florence and Ray are very helpful with questions about the apartment and Beijing. This is a great stay for English speaking guests in Beijing.
282825,"Florence and Ray are excellent hosts and the apartment is very nice. Great location, about a ten minute walk to the subway, and on the corner where it's very easy to catch cabs. Very interesting and engaging couple who gave us tips of things to check out in Beijing that Lonely Planet barely mentioned. Highly recommend this place- super convenient location and very good hosts. Two bedrooms plus kitchen plus two baths plus washing machine. Will stay again. Cheers!"
282825,"This is the best lodging experience I've ever had so far. Florence has been teaching for decades, and has been around. Talking to her, listening to her stories is a real pleasure. The place is spacious, clean and tidy. Everything in the house is well organised. The location is just perfect. It is close to the embassy area as well as the shopping centres, and takes less than an hour to get to the airport by taxi. And Hannah, our daughter, loves everything in that house. Would definitely recommend Florence's place to my friends. "
282825,"Florence was an absolutely amazing host. She provided a wealth of information and recommendations that really made our stay in Beijing great. Florence took time to help us with our day trips and recommended a driver to the Great Wall that made the whole trip so easy. The listing was everything we expected and more, we had a great time."
282825,"Florence is very nice!And the house is well decorated and beautiful. Nice location and convenience, we'd recommend to travelers. We loved the apartment,hope to stay again next time!"
282825,"This is the third year we have stayed in this wonderful apartment. It is in a terrific neighborhood, great variety of restaurants, shops, easy grocery shopping, walking distance to subway system, and has comfortable amenities."
282825,"As always, it was a pleasure! Had a great time in Beijing."
282825,"Worth the reputation of being the best Landlord in Beijing. Very helpful, kind and relaxing people."

282825,"The apartment is amazing. Fits 4 people perfectly, and is way more comfortable than I could ever imagine. The location is amazing, very near to everything I needed. Florence and Ray are amazing hosts, they know a lot about the city, and helped us with everything that was necessary. They are very organized and resourceful. Looking forward to be in Beijing and in this apartment again. 100% recommended."
282825,Very recommended
282825,"Florence and Ray were amazing hosts. They ensure that the check in was smooth and that someone is contactable when I needed something. The pre-itinerary she provided really helped me to navigate from the Airport to her home, and includes details that shows how meticulous she was. 

The home was 100% accurate from the photos, with nice ethnical art pieces. I love how everything is so comfortable and thoughtful. The building is very secured and conveniently located next to a mall and a supermarket across. Though it's my first time to Beijing for work, immediately I felt that I was home and it really help easing into Beijing so much easier."
282825,"It is a brand new experience for my parents. They felt at home and more relaxed, therefore it was helpful for them, considering at their age, to enjoy this 5-days trip with energy. Also, in person I like the house very much, it is cozy with thoughtful detail. And generally it is convenient for everything, food, entertainment, transportation, a good location to stay."
282825,"Florence & Ray are the niceness and super friendly couple i have met. They were there to meet me for the check-in, we talk for awhile and they showed me the popular places in Sanlitun as it's really close to the listing. Place is exactly as in the photos, it;'s clean and spacious. I would definitely recommend their listing for any travellers to Beijing."
282825,"房子很不错,但是收不到有线电视,带爸妈出来的,他们比较在意这个?"
282825,"Lovely house and great host! Will be back again, thanks Florence!"
282825,房子的位置特别好 特别方便 安静卫生 管家郑阿姨很负责 也很礼貌 住的很舒服 下次一定还会光顾! 同样感谢房子的男女主人 你们是有品味的!再次感谢!
282825,"距离地铁站有点远,其他都很方便"

282825,"Fantastic Sanlitun location within walking distance to shops, restaurants, and transit stations. The place was clean with plenty of amenities and a great view. The hospitality was above and beyond all expectations. Florence was super helpful, exceptionally prompt, and provided much needed assistance for novice China visitors."
282825,"We really enjoyed staying in this place. It is much better than other bnbs we had been to in China. It is beautiful, very clean, and very children-friendly. The location is very nice, with good restaurants and bars nearby. Convenient public transportation - two bus stops (Xing Fu San Cun 幸福三村 and Gong Ren Ti Yu Chang 工人体育场) to the major sites in Bejing. Overall, a great value to money.
我们来北京7天,之前住过一个很糟糕的地方,临时搬来了这里,简直太棒了?房子装修得非常漂亮而且实用,对有孩子的家庭也很适合,比宾馆的性价比高多了?主人对房子的清洁状况极其关心,每次有人住完后都会把房子空出一整天来出来做清洁?两个公车站(幸福三村和工人体育场)都是走几分钟就到了?其实英语不好的话来住也毫无问题,入住和退房的时候和房东交流总计不超过10分钟,我们住了七天期间不需要跟房东沟通(因为房子一切都很完备),房东也没有打扰我们?"
282825,My friends and I had a great time at Florence’s apartment. She went above and beyond to ensure we had a great trip. Thank you Florence!
282825,She was very good organized and planned everything for the guest.. And left small manual to make life easier for us...example hand described map where you can shop for grocery and near by best Peking Duck restaurants which was really good and we went there 2 times during our 4 days stay.  We were really appreciate for her efforts and warm hospitality.
282825,"房源地理位置很方便,整套房源毛巾干净?床单整洁?有安装净水系统,不错的体验,下次也会再预约,"
282825,"我是与房东聊了好几天以后才发现房东是位外国女士,而正巧我丈夫也是歪果仁儿,心想这样的房子一定符合丈夫的预期,果不其然?房间非常整洁?卫生,所有生活用品一应俱全,地板被清洁的一尘不染,还有一些书画,能感受到房主的生活品味,我是对卫生要求极高的人,这个房子是我住过最好最干净的,甚至比北京的五星级酒店都要好太多了,距离太古里只有一条马路的距离,实在是太方便了,屋内的生活用品质量都很高,非常感谢这次郑阿姨的接待,虽然她很唠叨,但是真的帮了我们很多的忙,给了我们很多有用的建议,希望后续入住的朋友们都能维护这个房子,保持它最初的样子?也希望再次见到唠叨的郑阿姨,会想您的?"
282825,房东旅行去了?管家来接的我们?屋内设施一应俱全?布置的非常舒适?有大量中国元素的艺术作品?让客人住在里面有在艺术馆的错觉?房东贴心的准备了各类儿童用品(婴儿床/儿童座椅/滑板车)?位置很不错出行很很方便?
282825,Excellent location in Sanlitun near restaurants and bars. Spacious apartment with free drinking water. Very prompt communication from owner who was extremely helpful with offer of driver to pick up from a airport (200RMB @$50).    And great instructions on location of apartment which was very clean throughout. We were met on evening of arrival and provided keys and given excellent run through of apartment. Air conditioning and wifi worked really well. Clean towels available and shampoos and soaps in bathroom.  Only small criticism- the lounge is quite uncomfortable but that was the only ‘very small’ thing I would like to mention.
282825,整体位置不错 房间也比较大
282825,"房源所在的三里屯附近交通便利,购物,娱乐,餐饮选择丰富?房间的空间很大,阳光充足,通风良好,淋浴水量很大,主人还贴心的准备了婴儿床和婴儿椅,多个睡袋,可以满足一大家人一起出行?"
282825,"La comunicación con Florence es buenísima , está siempre al pendiente  todas sus sugerencias súper atinadas e hicieron que el viaje fuera inmejorable. El departamento es muy amplio con todo lo necesario y en una súper buena ubicación . Sin dudarlo , volvería a quedarme en este lugar !!!"
282825,A good accommodation near Sanlitun.
282825,"Wonderful location and views with great amenities in area from DNA bar in complex to Lily American Diner across street for amazing western breakfast. Florence was quick on responses, flexible to our schedule, and had great insights to help for travelers looking to go beyond Beijing. Would stay again!"
287026,"This studio is well placed to get a subway,so it was very convenient for the trip.I highly recommend this place^^"
287026,"The room I booked was not available upon arrival. But Nathan fixed the problem the next day. Location-wise, it was conveniently situated - just several subway stations away from major sightseeing destinations. However, not for those who like to stay within walking distance."
287026,"After 12 hour flight and a six hour bullet train ride from Shanghai to Beijing, I was exhausted. Finding the place was a little hard, but definitely found it after giving Vera a call, who was also barely arriving for the night. First appearance, you feel safe as there are security at the front gate. 

I did not get to meet Nathan in person, but had called him on a few occasions. Which was not a problem since my partner had a phone that worked in China, otherwise we would have been in bad shape.

The four nights we stayed, we moved once, which was arranged prior to booking the place. First night we stayed in a one bedroom apartment, which was spacious, and had decent decor. 

The rest of our stay, we stayed in the studio which we had originally booked. We transferred our things the next morning. It was nice and cosy.   Wireless internet did not work. After waking up from our first night, there was no electricity. We called Vera, no answer so I went to her apartment. Felt bad I had to wake her up so early as we were leaving for Tian'amen Square. We ended up having to wait for someone to come to turn on the electricity per Vera's request, which I thought she should have done. So our plans were pushed back for about 45 minutes. The internet decided to work for us on our last night.

Otherwise, the location was decent. Close to some restaurants, which came in handy for breakfast. A few blocks from the subway. Mall is also close by. "
287511,"Ver convinient for a short stage in Beijing, good location and no probs wit any facility! And thats a lot here in Beijing!"
287511,"Our stay at Beijing has been great especially our accommodation. Location is very central, close walk to the train station that takes you everywhere especially to the airport. 

The room is very clean and almost everything you need in a apt. Best of all was the host, which both himself and his angel helper has been  great people to bounce of places of interest ad best food in town. 

Great level of communication during booking and also  during stay. 

Would guarantee go back to stay when back in Beijing "
287511,"Highly recommended. The apartment is conveniently located in a nice area. Dongzhimen station is around the corner and Sanlitun is just a 15 min walk away.  And Nathan is a great host. Very friendly, polite, helpful and efficient. Thank you!"
287511,"The apartment my husband and I rented from Nathan was just what we were looking for. The studio is clean, has internet/wifi, and a washer/dryer to name a few.  It's located inside a modern complex which has its own convenience store and nice common garden area.  The train from the airport is a 5-10 minute walk away as well as a couple of malls.  They both contain grocery stores and bakeries. Raffles has a BHG which I found had a better selection then Ginza's Ole.  
Nathan was a great help during our stay.   I highly recommend his apartments for those looking for a comfortable place to stay in Beijing."
287511,"Check-in process handled by one of Nathan's staff, Casey, was smooth and easy.

The room itself is fairly clean, however, the toilet itself isn't particularly clean. The shower itself wreaked of urine and cigarette stench which became worse as you showered.

The location and proximity to shops is good, however, entry to the premise is fairly confusing for a taxi driver. Please follow Nathan's email instructions carefully.

Nathan manages a number of these apartments apparently, so you may or may not be lucky, but overall at least the bed is fairly clean and room tidy."
287511,"I wanna thank Vera, for her amazing disposition.
We were in Beijing for Christmas and didn't want to spend it in an Hotel. So we search AirBnb and within 3 hours we were on our way to her Apartment in Beijing. 

The apartment is clean, simple, but with all necessary things. Central Heating, Wi-Fi and TV. 

Perfect for a Christmas with my girlfriend!

"
287511,"Nathan's apartment is a great base for your trip to Beijing - it's an easy subway ride to see the city's landmarks or a short walk to many great restaurants in Sanlitun Village. The apartment is spacious with plenty of closet space. The wifi is fast and dependable. And most importantly, in the dead of winter the apartment was very WARM. Good shower too. Great view of the city skyline at night, and I enjoyed watching the kids play in the schoolyard below during the day. The building is quiet, it isn't directly on a highway so no street noise, slept very well. "
287511,"Schnelle und einfache Abwicklung bei der Buchung und tolle Wegbeschreibung zum Studio, so konnten wir das Studio im gro?en Beijing ohne Probleme finden.  Gepflegte und sch?ne Unterkunft."
287511,T
287511,The apartment is perfectly located and close to a lot of restaurants and close to interesting Hutong areas. It is in a modern building with good security and a supermarket round the corner.  The apartment itself is friendly but would need some minor refurbishments. As an overall feedback we enjoyed the stay there.
287511,"Convenient location for exploring the city and access to all your basic needs (supermarkets, western/chinese food, coffee, dvd shop, etc.) This company has blocked out 20 apts to rent out in this high-rise building so the building is safe with 24-hour security--I used to live here and loved the communal, peaceful & central environment. Great service, they really go out of their way to answer any questions and help their guests out. Wouldn't blink before booking this place again."
287511,"This was my first AirBNB experience and I was very satisfied. The apartment was just as it appeared in the photos and description. Tracy (Vera's friend) was very helpful in getting me checked in and answering questions.   As a business traveler, I am a convert and will use Airbnb in the future. "
287511,"Overall, our experience has been wonderful.  The apartment is clean & tidy and has all the essential things that you would need to have a comfortable stay.  There are at least 2 convenient stores in the vicinity, where you could easily buy any food or drinks items even utility items.   There is even a small fresh produce market right next to the building location.   We prefer to prepare our own breakfast, hence, the studio well-equipped kitchen(stove, microwave oven, fridge, toaster, coffee maker, rice cooker) has been a god send to us.  Tracy & Sheila have been very helpful esp when we needed some contact for booking a driver for our tour to the Mutianyu Great wall.  The only downside that I could think of is the location of the subway, it is a 10 min walk.   wish it could be slightly shorter.  But otherwise overall it has been a great stay.  Would definitely come back to stay again "
287511,"We were so lucky to stay in this studio in Beijing. Th appartment was very clean and comfy enough for three people. The location is perfect for exploring the city, getting to/from the airport and the Great Wall! 
Tracy, a collueague of Vera, provided us with everything we needed and patiently helped us out with many of our problems! I could not really thank her enough for all she had done. We would definitely stay there again, when we come to Bejing again and will recommend this to our friends!"
287511,"Nice service, clean appartement, great location"
287511," We had a great time in Beijing. Was easy to find, Vera's colleges, Shiela and Tracy were friendly and helful. E.g. Organized us a 1 day trip to the Great Wall. The studio was clean and cozy in a safe surrounding, equiped with everyrhing you need. "
287511,"Perfect for our one night stay in Beijing. Close to the airport express, and they came to meet us on the street to find the place. Walking distance to Sanlitun etc. Thanks!"
287511,"Great place to stay in Beijing!!! Not far from the subway, not at all… just a small walk to it.
Tracy and all the staff were super attentive and helpful.
We booked our great wall trip with their assistance and it was a great experience over all. The apartment is cozy and doesnt lack anything to most overpriced hotels.

"
287511,Tracy was helping me out instead of Vera. Tracy was super nice and thoughtful. Some of the other staff were very nice in suggesting places to visit and things to eat. The apartment was very clean with a lot of extra amenities. I would definitely stay here again. 
287511,This apartment was very nice! The location was great! We had a blast here. Everyone that worked with Vera were nice and easy to get in contact with! 
287511,Good service. Great apartment. Recommended!
287511,"The studio was AWESOME! excellent location, very clean, and the washer was a great bonus. We arrived early and were able to check in with no problems. The little bao place right outside the gate was a great place to have breakfast. Will definitely use again, highly recommended. "
287511,"回覆速度快,房間很乾淨,值得推薦?:)"
287511,"We enjoyed our stay at the apartment, it's a great area walking distance from the Airport Express, Bus 916 to the area of the Great Wall we wanted to go to and a nice community with restaurants and shops nearby. 

It was a little difficult to find at first, if it wasn't for a very helpful local who talked to Virginia at the office for directions and walked us through -- after that we found out way back many different ways on different trips walking. 

Overall a good experience, comfortable room that looks as shown with everything we needed and more.  d

We didn't meet ""Vera"" but Virginia and the staff were very friendly and helpful --- Virginia even helped us find a good place to eat the first night as we were tired and didn't want to spend a lot of time trying to explore on our own.   She was helpful throughout our stay, thanks Virginia. 

Note, if you are a (Hidden by Airbnb) or (Hidden by Airbnb) user and rely on your email --- print out the instructions they provide for directions.  I was intending to just access my mail but on arrival in Beijing even with a sim card and wireless data plan we picked up at the Airport we found quickly that many things are blocked like (Hidden by Airbnb) , (Hidden by Airbnb) , (Hidden by Airbnb) .   Highly recommend installing a good VPN before your visit :)   

I would definitely recommend the location, it was easy to get around.  We did a DIY tour of the Mutianyu area of the Great Wall and really enjoyed it.  The 916 Express bus that you can catch from the station takes you to the area and you can catch a minibus or other bus from there.  (Hidden by Airbnb) it for more info or take a tour.   "
287511,"Had a good experience at Vera's apartment! Overall was clean and well equipped. Vera's colleagues responded to questions fast and were very helpful and friendly. Location is good, walking distance to Dongzhimen station and Sanlitun. "
287511,We are very glad to spend our days in these comfortable and cosy apartments with necessary equipments. It was a great pleasure to find some new year ornamentations at lobby and also in the courtyard. Office staff was very friendly and ready to help. They find to us a tea street and help to taste a roasted duck:) It was pleasantly surprised to find in appartment a cooler with drinking water! Also it is a great location espesually to get Great Wall by public transport. Highly recommended place!
287511,Vera was very forthcoming and particularly helpful ensuring we got safely to the apartment on the first night. The instructions to arrive were very precise including bilingual text for taxi driver. The area is very convenient and perfect for business trips. Lots to choose from in terms of  shops and restaurants. Would highly recommend to people. Thank you 
287511,"The apartment was easy to find and an easy walk from the airport express stop. We arrived early and there were a number of travellers waiting to get their apartment. We were lucky and got our apartment immediately. The check-in staff were very friendly and helpful with local tips and some cooking supplies (salt, soy sauce ...). The apartment was OK and had everything we needed for the few nights that we stayed. The location is very good with good transport and food in the area. The gated community has many international people and most people speak some English."
287511,"This appartment is absolutely perfect and Vera was a really, really! nice, friendly host!
When i arrived, my taxi driver dropped me a bit too early (600m away from the right address), i was a bit lost and sent a message to Vera. Vera was so nice to pick me up and show me the way to the appartment! She also offered that i can call her to negotiate with the taxi drivers. I did not make use of it cause I was using UBER for the whole week (can absolutely recommend that for Beijing!), however found it very comforting to know that Vera would be available as help.

The appartment was also great! Very clean, you have got there everything you need. The whole appartment complex is also nice and very calm. Locationwise i found it also very cool, you have got access to 2 malls in walking distance and via UBER you will be able to be in the centre (e.g. forbidden city) within less than 20min (which is a good deal for beijing)."
287511,"他们应该是一家比较专业的公寓出租机构,服务态度很好,比较专业,厨具餐具比较适合西餐,调料都可以找他们借,住起来还是比较舒服的?"
287511,"I had a great experience at Vera's studio. The location is ideal, and the staff was very welcoming and professional. I would definitely recommend this location to Beijing visitors. "
287511,"Awesome studio, nice and clean."
287511,"Very friendly and nice person. The room is very nice  Recommended 
"
287511,Apartment is clean enough in a decent complex.  Wifi was probably the worst I've ever used (not sure if terrible quality is standard for Beijing or not); would consistently cut out for hours at a time and when it would work connection is slow.  
287511,"The place is in a good location and the complex itself is pleasant and conveninet. Vera is not necessarily the person to talk to - it is a rental company and a few ladies are there from 8 am till late afternoon. They are efficient and will try to accomodate you within their limits. Do not expect any TLC.
As for the sutdio itself, it is quite worn out, not properly maintained and seems as if it was not painted for quite some time. Everything is functional but looks more like a 2 -3 star hotel from the end of the 90's. They clean every 4 days but would not change the sheets unless you specifically tell them.
A conveninet place for a couple days in Beijing"
287511,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
287511,"小区位置非常好,离地铁站也不远?小区的环境没的说,银杏树非常好看?房间干净卫生设施齐全,整体非常舒服?房东人超级nice热心"
314453,"The apartment was everything I asked for and I would stay there again.  

Fiona works for a company that rents out apartments in the building, but it didn't affect the quality of the stay.  

The apartment itself was clean, modern, and cozy with many built in shelves.  The kitchen was stocked with pots and pans and had a small fridge.  There was a large shower/tub combination in the bathroom.  The bed was comfortable.  

The location is right in the heart of Beijing, and Dongzhimen subway station is within walking distance.  

If you are looking for a comfortable long term or even short term apartment in Beijing with modern style and convenience, this is the place.  
"
314453,"For the price, the place is really great, with good facilities and location. it is just 7 mins walk from Dongzhimen subway station, which is surrounded by malls such as Ginza, Rafflescity. 

The company also provides regular cleaning services to the apartment, though the floor tends to remain dirty for some reason. The sheets are not superb, but considering the price and the location, i think it is a pretty decent place to stay. I give it a 6.5/10"
314453,Apartment is company owned and managed by a property management group. Location is good but generally it's more like staying in a good budget hotel rather than a private home like many others I've stayed in. Do not like the fact they ask you to go their office (though in a nearby location) to pick up the key and the fact that they ask for and photocopy your passport or ID.
314453,"Very convenient place. I recommend it to everyone who wants to live in a decent place with great location, without paying a lot for a hotel. I like the privacy and also the area of the place. "
314453,"The host is actually this place called rich and young service apartments. Had me run all over like a goose trying to find this place. First of all, it's not located across the street from the Austrailian embassy. You have to turn right at chunxiu road and it's on the left this building. The people had no clue where I was because I was standing in front of Jenny Lou's which is right around the corner and they thought I was lost when I was really 50 meters away from them. They will then require a 300 dollar refundable deposit which was never stated in the requirements for this flat and then this lady would take you to the flat which is across the street at Seasons Park. Luckily, I was upgraded to a suite which was really a one bedroom. 

The flat was spacious for one person however, the dryer washer was a bit weird. There was no instructions on how to use it and there was no shower curtain. Also parts of the bathroom wasn't so clean. "
314453,"1. Decent apartment with nice location, can walk to Sanlituan for around 10 mins.
2. The apartment i have been arranged was not the same as the photos.
3. The neighborhood is nice, with so many cute kids and expat.
4. Better make sure the taxi driver knows before taking, as I have few times experience that the driver can only took me to the nearby places, then i have to walk few mins to the apartment.
5. Value for money."
314453,The place was easy to find and the host was very helpful. 
314453,"nice little space, awesome location."
314453,"I did not stay in this apartment because it apparently was under construction.  The staff booked me in a larger room for the same price, which I appreciated.  I will not review the other room, but given that it was in the same building, and managed by the same people, I can provide feedback on those topics.  The building is a bit off the major road in an area filled with ex pats.  There are a series of gated communities with security staff, which makes the area feel secure.  A convenient store is located on the ground floor.  The management did not speak English well, though they were very friendly and helpful to the extent possible.  Via Airbnb, Fiona was very responsive and helpful as well."
314453,"desk service, show u the way to ur room"
314453,"Great place, well located, very clean"
314453,Great place in a good location near popular bars and restaurants. I'd stay there again if I was back in the city.
314453,"It hasn’t been a less than okay experience living in the apartment and dealing with the people involved, for the following reasons : First things first, the photos that the “landlord” used to advertise her apartment wasn’t exactly the real deal. According to the visuals , we were expecting “unblocked city view(high floor)” and clean apartment. When we were there, It was only then we realise that the “landlord” used photos of another apartment in the same building to advertise this particular unit on the lower floor of a different facing, and the living conditions were way below expectations, the floor were never clean(even though we have paid for the cleaning services to have someone to clean the flat once every two days), and the shower head were not in working condition as well. The “landlord” hasn’t been forecoming . We felt cheated. We were expecting to meet with the landlord when we arrive. When we finally meet with “Fiona”, We found out that she is actually the leasing agent of Rich & Young, a real estate agency dealing with sale & leasing of properties. There’s nothing wrong having to deal with a middleman or a leasing company, but again, we were not informed. Now that I am out of the apartment, I still do not know the name of the person that I was dealing with all these while. even when I asked if she’s Fiona , she didn’t deny or acknowledge. Level of professionalism ? None. On the 4th day before heading out for lunch, I have left an envelope containing 3000 chinese yuan on the study table in the apartment. By the time I come back for it (2 hours later), the money was no longer there. Apart from us, the agents and the cleaning staff had access to our apartment(The cleaning lady was on duty that day, and she was there when I was about to leave. Both parties quickly denied that they have never seen nor took the money. Nothing was done to make us feel any better with our loss, we had to literally “beg” the agent to help and advise us on the matter. In the end, we have to make do with filing a police report and move on . I am not saying that It was the agent or the cleaning lady who took our money, the least as someone working in the service line, please show that you care and are trying your best for your clients. It’s a shame . We were supposed to stay at the apartment for 10 days. Because the money were stolen and we no longer feel safe living in it, we decided to shorten our stay on the 6th day, and approached the agents for the early exit. AirBnB has empathised with our situation and already informed us that we can leave on the very day , and will refund us for the remaining 4 days, but the agents of Rich & Young insisted..."
314453,"This is my second stay at this apartment, and as previously, Fiona has her team provided a smooth and reliable experience. Keep up the good work~"
314453,"""Fiona"" is a rental agency called ""rich and young"", the room showed in the pictures are just for the layout. I was showed two rooms that were available upon arrival and was given a choice. Overall the location is close to the best parts of Beijing, close to the night life district and some of the best food places in Beijing. Downloading a uber app would be useful as bus stops and undergrounds are not exactly close to the location of the apartment."
314453,Easy to communicate. I have stayed with her in the past. The centrally location in a safe neighbourhood among embassies and 5 min walk to the airport express to Beijing Airport.
314453,Great apartment in a very nice neighborhood!  Very convenient for the airport or anything else in the city through Dongzhimen station.  
314453,"I booked the place two weeks before my trip (from San Francisco to Beijing - over 10 hours flight). The host won't not provide me with a room# but did respond to me and gave me the address and building#. When I arrived at the specific subway station, I called ""them"" (there is no Fiona). It was a long walk to their small office, about 40min. I was then told that their manager forgot to give them my Airbnb booking and they didn't have a room for me. It was 4pm, two hours after checkin time. They told me to go to Holiday Inn across the street, they also told me they cannot give me refund, I have to talk to AirBnB to get a refund. I went to Holiday Inn and it was fully booked. I then went back to their office  and insisted that they find me a room. They called, and found a room at another location that they (Rich and Young) manage. It took me another hour, and 40yuan of taxi ride to get there. I missed my meeting that evening! It was a nightmare!"
314453,一般
314453,"地理位置比较好,房间也不错,就是洗手间的花洒需要改进"
314453,"位置很好小区也很好很安静,房间内没有什么异味挺好的,但就是感觉卫生间淋浴区有点脏…毛巾看着基本上都不能用,最好自己带浴巾…床单也是一个问题,能看到明显的污渍,有条件的话床单最好也自备吧……"
314453,"环境很安静,交通也方便,物业管控不错"
314453,"房间挺大的,两个人住刚刚好
交通也相对方便
卫生间很干净
总的来说很满意"
314453,"We loved the hotel like feeling about this apartment. The location is so convenient, close to Dong Zhi Men station on line 2, and an easy walk to San Li Tun. There are plenty of supermarkets/convenient stores and restaurants in walking distance. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back again."
314453,"位置不错,房东人也很好,"
314453,"Great place, I would repeat if I go back to Beijing"
314453,小姐姐帮我换了更大的房间 地理位置也超级不错 有机会还会再定的
314453,一进门有很大的潮气 房间面积比实际照片中小一些 也比实际照片中要陈旧很多 可能注册营业日期是2012年 过了四年有些陈旧 角落杂物很多 卫生间浴室下水道有很大的异味 并不是民宿 而是一个类似于酒店式公寓的出租房 床单毛巾相对来说比较干净整洁 桌椅台面也比较干净 但是角落里灰尘很多 还有就是床垫太不舒服 弹簧特别突出 睡的非常不舒服 床垫质量太差了 卫浴用品质量也很一般 隔音效果还好 位置距离地铁口需要走15分钟 也算方便 设施陈旧 和图片预期不同 床垫很减分 总体来讲价比一般
314453,很不错 还有人打扫
314453,"位置不错,周边有很多的吃的和购物地方,距离地铁也比较近,房间面积ok,入住比较方便,不过卫生需要改进了,地板真的有点脏"
314453,为看莫文蔚工体演唱会订的 走路一刻钟就到 繁华地段 有很多外国人也选择住在这里 周围配套齐全 跟房东交流顺畅
314453,Host quick response.
314453,"还可以的,很安全的地方,就是有的景点距离有点远"
317195,"everything is well arranged. Fiona helped me a lot to check-in and out. 
subway and airport express station is 10 min walk, just as description I saw.
It's a very calm community. I will absolutely revisit when I stay in Beijing again."
317195,"Airbnb is a way to have a genuine experience abroad.  The reason I stay with Airbnb is to get tips from a local resident and get away from faceless hotels.  While the apartment was okay, that is all it was.  It is not lived in by the host and is managed by the apartment company once you get there (if you book with Fiona, be prepared to give the apartment company a 500 yuan deposit when you get there).  There was no tea or coffee and very little water left in the bottle that you drink from in most residences in China.  We had to buy our own water while staying there.    

The apartment is poorly finished with a tub that is detached and leaking.  The overall experience was okay, but I felt that it was not Airbnb, it's just an apartment company trying to flog out empty spaces through Airbnb.  Fiona called the people who showed us to our apartment her colleagues - so it was obvious that this is what they're doing.  Smart for their business, I can't fault them for that, but not what you're expecting if you want an Airbnb experience.  I would recommend a hotel in lieu of this place."
317195,"Seasons Park is a great location, Dongzhimen station is nearby, many restaurants and both Jenny Lou's and April Gourmet are very close. Walking distance to Yashow market. Very convinient!
The apartments (there are many) are in the nothern district of Seasons Park. Fiona didn't come herself, a management office (about five minutes away) takes care of the apartments. They were not prepared at all! They first showed us an apartment for only two persons, but we had booked an apartment for four people. The apartment was quite shabby. Although the building is only about 7 yeas old, this apartment already needs a renovation!
The ""suite"" they showed us later, had a double bed and a sofa. That means, one of us had to sleep on the floor (using the sofa cushions).  Prior to the booking Fiona told us, the apartment would be ok for 4, but it definitely is not!
Also, the apartmet was not clean! The plates and forks were dirty! That was not acceptable at all. 
We had many discussions with the management office about the cleaning, about the number of cups, plates etc. (2 cups for 4 persons...). At the end we got everything we wanted, but it was a long way!

322292,"Overall, Nathan has been really helpful throughout my stay. He helped me fixed the internet problem which I experienced during the first day and also with the taxi booking number. I would definately recommend my friends to stay there and use his service."
322292,Nathan's apartment was very clean and it's very well located. It's about 5 minutes walking from the subway station. There is a lot of good restaurant in the neighborhood. I strongly recommend this place.
322292,"Nathan was a great host and was able to help us in a pinch when we needed a single night to stay in Beijing when others couldn't.

It was a little tricky finding the place but this is only because addresses in Beijing are not easy to find. That said, the place is within easy walking distance from the last stop on the Airport Express Train.

Would recommend again if you needed an easy and nice place to stay when quickly traveling through the city."
322292,"This was my first time to use any accommodation through Airbnb and I had a great experience. The apartment, location etc...  was exactly as they said it would be, and it was all good.  The thing I was most impressed with was the super friendly, honest, reliable and responsive team that managed my stay on behalf of Vera; specifically Shelia and Tracy. They were always there to help me out if I had any questions, and made my 1 month stay very easy and enjoyable. I have absolutely no complaints and only good things to say about them, the apartment and the whole experience. I have no reservations in highly recommending this mob!"
322292,"Very pleasant experience... exactly as advertised and I expected. The area is also very convenient and reasonably quiet, short walking distance to Dongzhimen subway and SLT area."
322292,Good room as in description. Efficient ans friendly service. I'd stay here again
322292,very nice place and very friendly stuff. will come back again!
322292,"The apartment was clean, tidy, modern, didn't smell of smoke (though it is allowed) and looks exactly like the shown photos. Definitely the place I was looking for. The place is tricky to find, but the location 8 - 10 minutes from the Dongzhimen subway station along a quiet street made our stay very pleasant. From here you can reach many of the interesting spots in Beijing in a reasonable time and we definitely couldn't ask for more.

Unfortunately we didn't hear anything for a long time after our booking was confirmed by the Vera (or Vera's staff) and we only got informed about the address and how to deal with picking up and dropping off the keys to the building two nights before our arrival after several airbnb messages, a text message to her mobile and last but not least a phone call to china. We hope this was the exception to the rule. But as soon as we arrived, the staff around Vera was very helpful and kind.

In the apartment you will also possibly find the brochure for different tours to the great wall and a few other stops, presented on the book shelve. The staff arranged the booking and did a great job to help us. The tour on the other hand was quite a disappointment and I don't recommend to book the tour passing the jade and silk museums and an unscheduled visit to a tea ceremony as all these places consist of 10% guided tour space through the ""museum"" and 90% shopping space, what a waste of time, no kidding. Plus the extra 130 RMB we were confronted with in the tour bus to pay the chairlift to actually reach the wall in a reasonable time instead of hiking for 45 minutes as time was rather limited at the wall.

So I guess you understand where this is going, apartment great, location great, staff great (if you can reach them), tour terrible."
322292,Great place in convenient location.
322292,Vera is kind and the experience is excellent.
322292,Vera is very nice . The rooms are clear and it's convenient to the subway station . There are some retail stores in this area so u can buy things easily . Really nice trip!
398784,Very modern and decent apartment .Good location too .
398784,"The apartment is in a good location and well furnished. It's quite comfortable and I enjoyed my stay there.
"
398784,"This is second time I stay in East Apt. It's a great place to stay for a business trip in Beijing. Centre location. Clean and organized setup. Quiet neighborhood.  Highly recommended! 
"
398784,很不错的体验
445306,"My friends and I stayed in Betty's apartment for a week and couldn't have been more comfortable. The two bedrooms were large and easily slept the four of us. Everything about the apartment was great - having wifi, local phone, living room, and kitchen were all really helpful. The location is pretty ideal - right between two subway stops.

Betty was a great host, making sure we were comfortable and getting us set up with the right documentation with the local authorities. I highly recommend staying with her."
445306,"We really enjoyed Betty's apartment.  She threw in free cleaning and was on top of taking care of all of our needs.  Her English is impeccable as she lived in the US for 20+ years, so for anyone nervous about not being able to communicate in China she may be a great option.  Thanks Betty!"
445306,"The apartement was very nice, central and convinient. Betty and her helpers were eager to help.
It did take some time to register at the police station, but that is what happens when you stay at an apartement instead of a hotel.
We would defenitly come again."
445306,"Für einen kürzeren und vor allem auch l?ngeren Aufenthalt In Beijing
für mich war es die allerbeste Wahl:  Sehr zentral, viele Sehenswürdigkeiten lassen sich erlaufen, und zwei U-Bahn-Linien sind nur wenige Minuten entfernt, für alle die beruflich unterwegs sind. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr chinesisch, insofern hilft es sehr wenigstens etwas Chinesisch zu sprechen. Das typische Hutong, die keine  Strasse, hat alles, vom Obststand bis zum Baozi-Laden!  Die sch?ne kleine Anlage, in der das Apartment-Haus liegt, hat eine interessante Geschichte, davon kündet eine Tafel am Pf?rtnerhaus. Die Wohnung im Erdgeschoss ist wirklich sehr sonnig! Und vor den Fenstern der Schlafzimmer wuchsen Kürbisse, und das im Zentrum dieser Mega-Metropole! Die Zimmer sind sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet, nicht überladen. Als mein""Arbeitszimmer"" konnte ich das 2. schlafzimmer mit dem A,rbeitsplatz wunderbar nutzen. Alles hat  bestens funktioniert und die Betten sind sehr bequem! Das Hausmeisterehepaar war sympathisch und hilfsbereit und Betty - nochmals Dank dafür!! - hat via Mail schnellstens vermittelt, wenn mein Chinesisch nicht ausgereicht hat, und auch sonstige Fragen immer umgehend beantwortet. Ich habe mich nach 5 Wochen wirklich Zuhause gefühlt und hatte richtig Abschiedsschmerz, als ich aus beruflichen Gründen nach Shanghai weiterziehen musste.

There is no better choice, if you want to stay in (central) Beijing either you are a tourist or here to work. I stayed 5 weeks and loved everything: the tastefully decorated spacious sunny apartment, the -very chinese - neighbourhood ( it helps if you know a leats aliitle Chinese!) the small shops in the street and - of course- the trees in the compound with charme and history! Betty always helped me via Mail, if I had any questions or problems. The couple, looking after the apartment and cleaning the place, was  also very gentle. All together I had a great time  - and great autumn- weather too! - and I will be back, hopefully the next year in Beijing. September/Oktober 2012"
445306,"We are an American family of five (2 adults, 2 kids, 1 baby) and the apartment was just perfect for our week-long stay in Beijing. The location is very central, within walking distance (circa 15 mins) of Tian'an Men Square and Forbidden City. While we absolutely loved living on a hutong, it was also very helpful to have some large hotels (Hyatt, Regent) nearby when we had trouble communicating with cabbies, etc. The apartment itself was clean, spacious, comfortable and quiet. We all slept very well. (Don't expect 5-star ammenities, but rather tasteful Ikea, which was perfectly fine by us.) The owner, Betty, was extremely professional and easy to deal with. We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend Betty's apartment to any family or group wanting to get a taste of real Beijing."
445306,"We stayed for 6 days in this lovely apartment with our baby daughter and it was perfect for our holiday.  Spacious, comfortable and warm (it had just snowed in Beijing before we arrived  so we were grateful for the central heating!).  Betty has provided all the facilities you would need. The apartment is set within a quiet garden courtyard, but is 2 minutes walk from lots of shops and restaurants.  And is conveniently located for the metro as well. Would highly recommend."
445306,"My family and I stayed at Betty's Flat for our first stop on a month long trip to China.  As this was our first time using Airbnb outside of the US, we were a bit hesitant at first, but Betty's excellent communication before and during your arrival reassured our confidence in our stay.  The cab driver had no trouble finding the flat with the directions Betty gave us beforehand and even if we took a subway, it's located only a 5-10 minute walk from 2 different subway stations. 

The flat is very centrally located, spacious, well laid out, and very new and modern.  It definitely felt like a home away from home and served as a better option than any hotel.  Everything was thoughtfully laid out for guests.  It was the perfect accommodations to come home to after a long day of sightseeing and dodging the November cold of Beijing.  

The location was absolutely perfect.  Only a 5-10 minute walk to 2 different subway stations and plenty of great eating establishments near and around the flat! 

We've been in 3 other cities since Betty's flat and we cannot stop raving about it!  It has by far been our best accommodations in China.  

"
445306,"If you are looking for a comfortable, convenient and all around great place in Beijing then this is where you want to stay. The pictures on airbnb’s website are exactly what you will see when you enter this apartment. We arrived in December when the temperature had suddenly dipped and coming into this apartment there was no shortage of heat! This apartment was a very short walk to the subway station and from there the city is was ours to discover. Not only are the major tourist sites a short way away, both by subway or walking, but the surrounding area is quiet with plenty of places to eat. For those who prefer to cook there is a wonderful vegetable seller just around the corner and plenty of small convenience stores. Betty is outstanding and is always a phone call or email away and her pre-arrival package helped our taxi driver get us to the apartment from the airport easily. She responded to all of our emails and bent over backwards to help us. She even called us when we had arrived to make sure everything was okay and to see if we had settled in okay. The wonderful Chinese couple that takes care of the place were also very generous and helpful. Summer, winter, spring or fall, if you are going to stay in Beijing then this is the only place to stay."
445306,"What a great experience!

I don't know what to be happier about, the quiet, comfortable, clean apartment; or Betty's willingness or rather eagerness to help us have a wonderful time in Beijing.  

My family and I stayed in Betty's apartment for a week in the cold of January.  The apartment was very well kept and surprisingly cozy and warm.  If you've not traveled much in China, you will learn that counting heaters in the winter, or AC in the summer is a good idea before you book.  Each day of our trip it was so wonderful to walk back off the main streets into the little neighborhood and into the cozy quiet warm apartment.  

If we return to Beijing, this will be my first choice on places to stay.  "
445306,"We had an excellent stay at Betty's Beijing apartment.  We were 4 young professionals on vacation & this apartment was perfect for our needs.  It is clean and has everything you need (towels,etc.).  It is a short walk to Wangfujing & the Forbidden city, and a short cab ride to the SanLiTun bars.  We visited in February & were happy that this apartment stays warm with great heating :)

The coolest part about this apartment is the small lane it is located on.  It is a modern apartment on a very cool old-Beijing looking lane.  There are great local restaurants, a dumpling place 1 block away, and even a Jian Bing stand some mornings (try it!).

Betty was incredibly helpful & even put us in contact with a driver for our Great Wall excursion.

Highly Recommend.  Thanks Betty! "
445306,"Betty's apartment is just superb. It is in one of the most central locations in Beijing and within walking distance to Beijing's Wangfujing shopping district with plenty of restaurants and a 5 minute stroll to subway lines 1 and 5. It's also very close to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. 

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a central location in Beijing and who would like convenience. I would also reccomend this place for any small group or family as it has all the amenities you require for a perfect stay. The central heating worked a treat in the unusually cold Spring in Beijing.

Thanks for a great stay Betty!"
445306,Beautiful apartment and great location - a short walk to the Forbidden City.
445306,"My two sons (7 & 10), my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our brief stay at Betty's. We arrived late and were greeted by a friend of Betty's who helped us settle in. The apartment is lovely and historic complex is charming, even better than the photos. It was a moment of peace and relaxation in the middle of a busy trip. We wish we stayed an extra day or two."
445306,My friend and I stayed in Betty Wu's apartment in Beijing. Betty was extremely helpful and ensured all our needs were attended before and during our stay. Thanks  Betty! 
445306,"This was our first international apartment rental, we speak no mandarin, and we were travelling with our two kids- so there was lot that could have gone wrong. Instead things went great. The location is ideal, with major hotels, malls and even McDonald's close by (if you need those things)  but the apartment and the street make you feel like a local (maybe a lucky and rich one). Betty's local manager and nice older neighbors were very friendly and helpful through the language barrier. Her recommended guide Kevin was extremely enthusiastic and we had a wonderful Great Wall tour with him.  Otto's restaurant next door is very popular with locals and has an English menu- just grab a number from the guy in front and wait for your table.  Overall- all the other great reviews are accurate and well deserved. Highly recommended.  "
445306,"When my husband and I travel, we try to go a bit off the beaten path and as much as possible, attempt to live like a local versus staying at large tourist filled hotels.  This apartment was perfect.  Not only did we feel like we were truly living like a local, but it was also much more cost efficient and spacious compared to a hotel.  Our 3 year old daughter loved the space, exploring the rooms.  And since she goes to sleep much earlier than us, it was very convenient to put her to sleep and then go and sit in the living room and watch a movie or eat dinner.  The side street that the apartment is on is great, small restaurants with delicious, I mea deliciou, food.  We even felt comfortable eating street food (only the cooked items) including minced pork dumplings (only 1 yen each!!) and egg pancake compete with the fixings - YUMM!! (both places are to the right when you exit the courtyard).  We were also able to arrange with the host Betty to have some groceries already available at the apartment upon our arrival (since we have a 3 year old, we just wanted to have things ready after our flight and arrival) and that worked out great.  We were able to have toast and bananas for breakfast, as well as some good coffee and tea (provided).  The convenient store was right across the street where we were able to get some eggs and other items.  It was just great not to have to feel like we needed to get up and out to get breakfast, we could leisurely get ready in the morning with our breakfast and then head out (especially knowing lunch and dinner would be out).  Mr. Gui was great, our flight was delayed twice and yet he was still at the apartment to greet us and show us around the apartment (even though he does not speak english, he was still able to point and show things).  The washer and dryer were convenient but expect the dryer to take awhile so just don't plan on doing all your laundry the night before you leave if you have to pack it as it may still be damp.   And the entry at dark could be a little scary (you have to walk in courtyard, down ramp, up a couple of stairs, into a hallway, stomp your feet for the light to go on), but it is worth it to have a quiet relaxing place to stay.  Would go back in a heartbeat!!"
445306,"Wonderful location in a very welcoming complex of small buildings. The apartment, itself was very well appointed and very comfortable. The hutung on which the apartment is located is amazing with a wonderful crepe and egg stand right nearby. An easy walk to Tian'an emen square and the Forbidden City. We were greeted by a friendly person who had no English but was fully competent at explaining the apartment features and called a man who helped, when needed. The only problem was when we left and wanted a taxi to the airport and they wouldn't stop for us. Odd, but the one we finally stopped worked well and got us there with plenty of time to spare.
Definitely a five star accommodation."
445306,"Lovely, clean apartment with thoughtful conveniences.  In a pretty old compound and the street outside is full of food vendors and shops.  Convenient to sights in central Beijing.  Betty referred us to Kevin, who arranged drivers, helped us with train tickets, and took us to the Mutianyi Great Wall. He is a friendly, well-informed man and very helpful when we had trouble navigating in China. I would highly recommend this for the traveler who wants convenience and comfort within a more traditional Chinese neighborhood.  The apartment would be a great place to stay for a longer-term business trip, too.  Thank you for the great communications and hospitality, Ms. Wu.

445306,"We loved our 2 nights in Betty's spacious apartment. It is quiet, private and in a walled compounded with other lovely old brick homes, surrounded by mature trees. The lane outside has a restaurant, just 30 metres to the left as you go out the gate, where you can have a meal of Peking duck for 100 Yuan, or a little extra if you order rice too. We walked to Tianaman Square and the forbidden city. A huge modern mall is just across the road and 100 metres along. Betty was very helpful and friendly to deal with. Her caretaker was waiting for us at the gate and showed us around inside. A wonderful place to stay."
445306,"Betty's apartment is what AirBnB is all about, with an incredible location in central Beijing! In the morning we strolled through the beautiful residential courtyard seeing the neighbours up and about, into the always bustling and incredibly full of life Hutong (go eat!), and then out into very central Beijing - truly amazing! The equivalent of staying in London down a quiet lovely Soho street. Near to several subway lines - RMB2 per journey (￡0.20) which made getting further afield simple. A gorgeous period building with gorgeous dark hardwood floors, HIGH ceilings and such space! We stayed in 8 places across our China trip and this by ar was the biggest. In fact we were so at home we opted to not be crazy tourists seeign everything to enjoy spending time here as it was a real home away from home. Kitchen (food is easy to get all hours in the Hutong), bathroom and washing machine facilities were all used and all perfect. Thanks to Mr Gui for patience waiting for us to check in after our flight was delayed, plus to Betty herself for flexible checkout to suit our plans - both made the experience seamless. Great email contact with Betty pre and during the trip also and I never had any question go unanswered.
AMAZING location, a real home away from home, and we were shown real hospitality from our hosts - I would not hesitate to recommend for couples (we were 2 couples), on business and families also as there is so much space. Thankyou very much Betty - we will be back!"
445306,"We stayed 5 days in Betty's charming apartment in the center of Beijing. The apartment is lovely, tastefully decorated and very well located: the dongdan metro station is a very short walk distance, and we also walked from the apartment to the forbidden city and Tienanmen place. 
Betty was always available to answer our question via email, and gave good advice to get around the city.
To sums things up, we could not have had a better accommodation in our stay in Beijing, I really recommend it!
"
445306,"Better than most hotels. Plenty of room, comfortable beds, great bathroom. Kitchen well equipped. Easy walk to subway and lots of attractions, shops.
Betty responded very quickly when we needed her.

Would stay here again."
445306,"I really enjoyed my stay at Betty's flat. The flat was spacious, quiet, and really comfortable and the location was also ideal. Betty and her team were also extremely helpful (booked transport the the Great Wall, access to a translator if necessary and cleaned the flat regularly). I would strongly recommend staying at Betty's flat."
445306,"Cosy, clean and quiet flat. Very well located, 5 minutes walk from the subway (only 3 stations from the forbiden city and Tiananmen). Groceries are nearby, even if you are looking for some western food (we had kids of 2 and 6 years old to feed and often went to Olé Supermarket in Wanfujing Shopping Plaza). You can also find a lot of restaurants. The kids could play in the courtyard between two visits : a rare opportunity in downtown Beijing. We really enjoyed our stay. "
445306,"A very good stay in BJ.
The location is perfect. 10 minutes by foot to Wangfujing, 15 minutes to the Forbidden City (which is very little by BJ standards).
The flat is clean, everything is done for the resident to have a good experience of the city.
M. and Mrs GUI are very kind and efficient. May they be thanked many times.
You can go for it without afterthoughts.
Betty is having at heat the well-being of the residents!"
445306,Great place and the best location for people who travel in BJ by public transportation. 
445306,"Betty Wu's flat was very clean, spacious, and comfortable.  We loved the location and the surrounding environs.  Much more authentic than any hotel!  We appreciated the attentive customer service, too.  "
445306,"Great place, great location and facilities. Betty also makes everything very easy."
445306,"We had a wonderful experience in Betty's apartment.  The place is exactly like you see in the pictures, clean, bright and cozy.  It is located in a rather small street, so make sure you bring the map that Betty provides for the taxi driver.  It was our first experience with airbnb, wow!!! It was perfect! Thanks Betty for everything, you and the lady that manages the apartment in Beijing are great hostess doing more than we've expected.  Thanks!"
445306,Unique space in the middle of Beijing. Very comfortable stay.
445306,"This was the first AirBnB apartment we have ever stayed at and it was a wonderful family vacation, made all the more enjoyable by Betty's apartment. 

It is exactly as described, clean, spacious (we are a family of 4) and modern. It was also located within walking distance of all the Wangfujing sights and sound (we particularly enjoyed the Dadong Beijing duck!!)

It was also within a 20 minute walk to both the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square. 

I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Beijing, and we look forward to coming back again in the near future."
445306,"It has been one week when I back from Beijing. This is the 1st time I took my family ( my parents, my wife and my 3y son)  to Beijing and stay there more than 15 days. It was real wonderful and impressive trip. Many thanks for Betty, she app'd my requirement and her apartment provided us very comfortable and home feeling room. I just want to say Betty's apartment was perfect in every respect. 

Location: The centre of Beijing, 10 mins walking to Wangfujing Street. Main line#1,#5,#6 subway station is just 5 mins way. To Tianan Men Square, take 2 stops only. The public tansport is just 20 steps outside of the door. 

Facility: Two bedroom with 150cm width bed, which is enough for 2 person/bed. Clean, Warmth, Completed kitch devices which can be cooked by yourself if you like. ( we cooked ) Coffee machine, Micro Wave oven, refrigerator, Laudary, Dryer... All of these let u feel u just change another better home to stay. 

In a word, trust me! Highly recommend Betty's Apartment which wl be your best and correct choice. If you want to leave a good memory of Beijing Trip, pls do it now!!!! 

Tks Betty again! "
445306,The reservation was canceled 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
445306,"We loved our stay at Betty's apartment. We were in Beijing for 2 months for my husband's work and with two small children I was looking for a place that was more like home. Betty's apartment fit our needs. It was very comfortable, had character, nicely decorated, was convenient and close to many tourist destinations. Betty was a great host, we didn't meet her personally, but she was always responsive via email. I would definitely stay here again and would not hesitate to recommend anyone staying here. "
445306,"My husband and I were travelling with our two children aged 8 and 6 and for us this apartment was just perfect. It is in a great location - 5-10 min walk to the closest subway staion (Dongdan) and is also walking distance to some of the main sights such as Wanfujing Street, Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden Palace. We also really enjoyed some of the local restaurants in the hutong such as Otto's (ate there numerous times - they also do take-away) as well as the restaurant that has Peking Duck, can't remeber the name but it was delicious and very reasonably priced. We also felt very safe walking around this area, even at night. Our kids also really liked the courtyard out the front of the apartment and it was nice fore them to have a quiet place to explore and play. The apartment itself was very clean and stylishly furbished and quite spacious, even compared to western standards. Betty was also a great host and provided clear communication and we had no troubles with our arrival despite it being very late at night. I will be recommending this apartment to all of my friends and family."
445306,"Great apartment, would stay again when I'm next in Beijing!"
445306,"Прекрасное место, самый центр города, рядом хутуны с  колоритом старого Пекина, в двух шагах улица Ванфуцзин, две станции метро.
Тихий старый дипломатический квартал, уютная квартира с хорошей мебелью, современным оборудованием.
Рекомендую всем, кто останавливается на несколько дней в Пекине и хочет домашнего уюта."
445306,"We arrived early in the morning and Betty was kind enough to have Miss Lu (manager) hold our luggage while the apartment was being cleaned for us. When we got back from our first day of sightseeing, the place was clean and welcoming. Wifi works great, which is a must for travelers. We used the washer once and Betty has a print out ready in english. The location of the apartment is great. Just a 15 min walk to Wangfujing Street where you can experience Chinese street food and shopping centers.

Eating Tip: The small street outside the apartment is a gem. At first it might seem like a run down street, but once you get used to Beijing it feels like home. It is packed with great restaurants that forms a line every night. We especially liked the bbq place that sells all sorts of skewers. Just go out and explore."
445306,"非常棒的老房子,院子很漂亮,虽然是住一层,但是采光非常好,非常舒服,一次满意的住宿经历,会推荐给朋友:)"
445306,Great apartment in Beijing! Very clean and big- we were given water when we arrived. Only drawback is the lack of lighting when getting back to the apartment at night but we were given a flashlight.
445306,"Wir (2 Erwachsene und 2 Jugendliche) haben eine tolle Woche in Peking in Betty`s Appartment verbracht. 
Betty hat unsere Anfragen immer freundlich und kurzfristig beantwortet. Vielen Dank dafür.
Die Wohnung verfügt über 2 Schlafr?ume, Küche, Wohnzimmer, Esszimmer und ein kleines Bad mit Dusche, Waschbecken und WC. Alles ist sehr sch?n eingerichtet und Miss Lu sorgt dafür, dass die Wohnung sehr sauber ist. Es ist eigentlich alles vorhanden, was das Urlauberherz begehrt. Von der Wohnung sind es ca. 5 Gehminuten zur Fu?g?ngerzone der Haupteinkaufsstra?e Wangfujing (wenn man die Abkürzung über das gegenüberliegende Krankenhausareal nimmt). 
Die Wohnung ist nicht ganz leicht zu finden. Bei einer Anreise bei Dunkelheit ist eine Taschenlampe von Vorteil, denn die Umgebung ist ziemlich dunkel. Unser Kleinbus, mit dem wir angereist waren, konnte leider die Wohnung über die enge Zufahrtsstra?e nicht anfahren, so dass wir unsere Koffer ziemlich weit schleppen mussten. Miss Lu organisierte dann aber kurzerhand den Postboten, der unsere Koffer auf das Dach seines Dreirades packte und sie zur Wohnung fuhr. Vielen Dank dafür.
"
445306,"This was our first trip to China and I was concerned about were to stay while in Beijing. My wife and I were traveling with our adult children and a new son-in-law. Our oldest son would be meeting us in Beijing, flying in from Xian, where he is teaching. 

I discovered Betty's apartment on Airbnb and was very impressed with the description, pictures, and location of the apartment. It all turned out as stated when we arrived. 
The apartment was clean, organized, well furnished, comfortable beds, had a safe for valuables, and the wi-fi
worked perfectly. There were six of us, but Betty had arranged for two cots to be set up for our boys to sleep on. Which worked out just fine. Thanks to Miss Lu. (Manager)
The location of the apartment is in an old hutong area, but is very close to many must see sites. What I enjoyed most was the experience to see and be a part of the everyday happenings 
that were right out the front gate of the apartment. Several restaurants
within 200 feet, a bakery, a a noodle restaurant making their noodles from scratch, and a restaurant that serves Peking Duck. (Excellent) Even a couple of food vendors selling their snacks, dumplings, a Chinese breakfast wrap, all at very, very reasonable prices. Which you will find as the norm and not the exception. I could go on and on, but I 
won't, I'll just say, Thank you Betty,
we will definitely stay here again if we are in Beijing ever again, it was an adventure never to forget.

445306,"Fantastic place. Highly recommended.  So interesting, but also so well renovated.  Very clean and great communication.  We felt very welcome. Our host even brought us some lunch when we arrived as she thought we might be hungry! We travelled with two children aged 18 months and 3.5 years. It was very big and suited us perfectly.  Great price and location. Thank you!"
445306,"My family of 5 adults spent our time in Beijing resting at this apartment. The building was a bit hard to find at first (the building number cannot be seen from the main road, you have to walk between some buildings to find it) but once we called Ms Lu (the one who takes care of the building) she was quick to come out and find us. Betty's apartment was very nice inside. They take very good care of the apartment and the decor was also really tasteful with a lot of nice pictures and decoration, and a whole box of DVDs to watch movies. Everything was very clean, the shower was able to give out hot water for all five adults each night, amenities were fully stocked, the air con worked quickly, and the daytime lighting inside the apartment was also good. They were nice enough to provide us with disposable slippers for our stay even though we had brought our own. The location of the apartment itself is very convenient and close to many Beijing tourist attractions (T. Square, a night market with awesome food, a huge outdoor shopping strip, the subway). Ms Lu was also a really nice host/contact who we could call if we had any questions. She helped get us registered with the local police and even helped us get two Taxis around 4:30am in the morning to make it back to the airport in the morning (since the subway doesn't open until 6-7am). The only problem we had were 1-2 mosquitoes getting into the apartment each day but that was to be expected for any 1st floor apartments in Beijing (just bring mosquito spray). Overall we enjoyed our stay in Betty's spacious apartment and were really glad to have found this place. :) "

The location is amazing -- in the heart of a hutong, and next to a TON of great little eateries.  Also, just walking distance from the subway, Wang Fu Jing, the Forbidden City and a ton of other great places.

I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."

I arrived at Betty's place around 1 am-ish and Ms. Lu was very accommodating for the late check-in, which was a relief because I was tired and was hoping for a smooth check-in.
 
This spacious 2-bedroom apartment was walkable to Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, Silk Street, 4 shopping malls (that I counted of), Starbucks, KFC, and McDonalds.  If you really want to walk it, you could also spend an hour or so and walk to Sanlitun and take a cab (or Uber China) back.

Even though there is a fully equipped kitchen, you won't ever need to cook as there are plenty of eateries (and fresh fruits and freshly squeezed pom juice) just right outside the compound.   

A perk for me at Betty's place was the washer and dryer.  After trekking the back country in southern China the week before, the washer and dryer (western toilet and cleanliness of the place) was a godsend and was the perfect wrap-up to my China trip.

Throughout the whole trip (and even before my stay at Betty's place, while I was staying elsewhere in Beijing), Betty was very responsive and helpful.

This is a great place to stay if anybody is looking for a place that is comfy, quiet, and yet still in the heart of everything.

Thank you for sharing your place, Betty!
